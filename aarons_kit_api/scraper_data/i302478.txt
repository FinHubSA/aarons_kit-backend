 abstract = {The time-series behavior of the quarterly earnings, sales and expense series of 69 firms over the 1946-74 period is examined. A Box-Jenkins time-series methodology is adopted. Based on inspection of the cross-sectional autocorrelation function, it is concluded that each series has (a) an adjacent quarter-to-quarter component and (b) a seasonal component. One-step-ahead forecasting results reveal that these two components can be successfully modelled at the individual firm level. The use of various quarterly forecasting models in security price analysis is also examined. The results are consistent with the market adjusting for seasonality in quarterly earnings in interpreting each quarter's earnings change.},

 abstract = {Working mainly from the literature of modern organization theory, it was possible to develop a model of organizational performance for internal subunits. The model hypothesizes three major contingencies which affect subunit performance: (1) factors internal to the subunit (internal factors); (2) interrelationships with other subunits (interdependency factors); and (3) interactions external to the firm (environmental factors). The contingencies operate differentially across organizational subunits. Three propositions derived from the model were examined empirically in a field study of large manufacturing organizations. Strong support for two of the propositions was found, along with indications of support for the third, by using the analytical methodology of path analysis. The final section of the paper explores the implications of the study approach and results for managerial accounting theory and practice.},

 abstract = {The author argues that the accounting profession should investigate further the possibilities of recording compensation expense at the date of grant differently than under present generally accepted accounting principles. The economics and finance literature provides evidence that option contracts can be valued, although an exact evaluation formula still is not devised. However, the literature is remarkably consistent with respect to the variables to consider and the range of values that are appropriate for a given set of conditions. Although an exact figure probably never can be known for any option, it is reasonable to assume that the value for an option can be approximated with a high degree of confidence. In the case of nonqualified stock options, it would seem that the models provide a good answer to our valuation problems. On the other hand, qualified stock option plans involve more variables, and it appears that additional research is needed to model their restrictive components.},

 abstract = {Internal audits derive their utility from the information which they provide about the effectiveness of the firm's system of internal control and from the effects they may have on the behavior of that system, both before and after the audit has been performed. This study concentrates on the informational aspects of internal audits, with particular attention being given to audit timing. A sequential decision process is defined wherein the objective is to minimize expected total discounted costs. The decision process can be characterized as an infinite-state, time-varying Markov decision process, and, accordingly, the decision model can be called a Markov decision model. Solutions to this model are obtainable by dynamic programming.},

 abstract = {Price changes have long been recognized in both accounting and economic literature as being a serious problem. One widely advocated solution has been general price-level accounting. This article reports the results of applying general price-level accounting techniques, as set forth in the FASB's December 1974 exposure draft, for each of 1,050 U. S. companies for each of 3 recent years. Summary income statements and balance sheets were developed for each company by using (1) data from the Compustat annual industrial files; (2) changes in the general price level as measured by the GNP Deflator Index; and (3) self-constructed computer programs intended to produce approximations of amounts which would have been reported had the firms been applying the FASB-proposed restatement techniques. Summaries of the approximated price level data and ratios based thereon form the empirical finding of the study which provides an overview of what the impact would have been for more than a thousand companies had the FASB's proposal already been in effect. In summary, that impact varied greatly among individual firms and industry groups.},

 abstract = {A study was made of the decision process employed by CPAs when resolving materiality issues. The hypothesis tested was that the decision reached concerning the materiality of an item is influenced by the degree of uncertainty about the final resolution of the issue and the CPA's willingness to accept the risk of an incorrect decision. The technique of cardinal utility curve analysis was used to examine the materiality decisions of nineteen partners of CPA firms. Responses were elicited to three independent hypothetical cases. Risk attitudes were observed by assessing utility values for the amounts involved and by comparing the subjects' responses with risk-neutral responses. The analysis revealed that in the two cases involving accounting matters, an average of 55.3 percent of the participants were risk-averse and 34.2 percent were risk seekers. The hypothesis of the study was accepted: the accountants tested were found to react aversely to uncertainty in materiality decisions.},

 abstract = {Integrated sampling procedures have been suggested in recent accounting literature. Yuji ljiri and Robert Kaplan have proposed a nonlinear model which, when solved, yields a sampling procedure which satisfies several auditing goals. This paper presents a solution procedure for the proposed model. The solution procedure takes advantage of lagrange multipliers to create a problem which is linear in the constraints and convex in the objective function. A search technique then is used in conjunction with the convex simplex method to solve the problem. The procedure is used to test the model results in an actual auditing environment. The results of this study indicate the feasibility of using this approach for generating sampling designs.},

 abstract = {A general mathematical model is developed to assist in planning the transfer of wealth to heirs. In most cases, the present value after federal taxes is maximized by some combination of estate and gift transfer. The existence of an optimal combination is a consequence of the progressive nature of tax rates, not the particular rates now legislated. The method of equated rates is developed, using calculus, to solve the problem of maximizing the present value of wealth received by the heirs. The method can be applied manually for simpler cases and provides a theoretical basis for computer solutions involving unknown time of death, growth and other complications. The model is general enough to be used to analyze the impact of proposed changes in estate and gift tax laws.},

 abstract = {This paper reports the results of an empirical investigation of whether firms making accounting changes differ significantly from firms not making accounting changes. The paper relates directly to a study conducted by Gosman [1973] and to critical comments based upon that study [Cushing and Deakin, 1974]. The research methodology focused upon differences between firms which reported accounting changes vis-a-vis an auditor's consistency exception and those firms reporting no changes. The experimental sample was based upon 10-K reports filed with the SEC between 1 January and 30 April 1973. From this population, 1,543 firms were selected randomly and dichotomized as changers and nonchangers. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized in examining for significant differences among three firm characteristics-size, auditor and industry. Three additional variables were incorporated into the analysis as potentially confounding variables-(1) fiscal year, (2) existence of extraordinary items and (3) direction of earnings. An important contribution of the utilization of the ANOVA procedure was testing for interactions among variables. The results suggest that size, industry and the reporting of an extraordinary item on its financial statements are associated with the likelihood that a firm will report an accounting change.},

 abstract = {Present value depreciation has been explored in the literature as a means of reconciling the conflict between the internal rate of return of capital budgeting models (IRR) and the return on investment computed from financial statement data (ROI). Accounting accruals of cash flows confound the use of present value depreciation for this purpose, and a number of writers have suggested ways of recording accruals that yield to IRR-ROI consistency. This paper examines further the problems created by accounting accruals. The analysis shows that with the accruals required by the complete disaggregation of a project's net cash flows, IRR-ROI consistency often may be obtainable only at the cost of producing individual account balances that lack suitable economic interpretations.},

 abstract = {Some corporate groups that file consolidated returns use different methods to allocate the consolidated tax liability for tax return and financial reporting purposes. Such dual allocations can cause the tax liability reported in an affiliate's financial statements to differ from the liability it reports to the Internal Revenue Service. This is not a "timing" or "permanent" difference as the terms normally are used. Differences arising from dual allocations are the focus of this paper. The paper examines the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities. An illustration is used to demonstrate the allocation methods specified for tax purposes, and the fact that the results of these methods generally do not conform to sound accounting practice is noted. An allocation method consistent with sound accounting practice then is proposed. Finally, the practice of using different allocation methods for tax and financial reporting purposes is examined, and the need for action by the accounting profession in this area is pointed out.},

 abstract = {The discounted present value concept plays an important part in accounting theory, often being viewed as the ideal concept of value. There is, though, a school of thought which, while recognizing the importance of the concept in decision making, argues that the primary function of financial accounting is in the assessment of achievements. It also argues that this indicates a need for ex-post measures which are conceptually distinct from discounted present value. This note complements their work by arguing that accountants do not have a comparative advantage in the determination of discounted present value for investors and that this task should be left to the stock market.},

 abstract = {A variety of decision models for cost variance investigations have been suggested in the accounting literature. However, few of these models explicitly have recognized that users of these models seldom have perfect knowledge of the model parameters, particularly parameters such as the average cost when "out of control." In this paper, the issue of parameter uncertainty in cost control is addressed in two ways. First, the expected cost (or loss) arising from misestimating the parameters is estimated using two methods (numerical approximation and simulation). Then a model comparison scheme is introduced for using reported costs to make inferences about the parameters of the cost process, resulting in a "learning model" by which a manager may use an investigation to find out about the cost process, as well as to correct an out-of-control situation.},

 abstract = {Empirical inflation accounting research often requires the use of capital expenditures data in order to estimate dated layers of long-lived assets. This dated-layering then is used as a basis for computing either general or specific price-level adjustments. However, the definitions and policies employed in the reporting of capital expenditures on Compustat result in data which are not appropriate for this layering objective. It is shown that naive use of this data can lead to a systematic and potentially significant bias in estimating fixed asset ages. More detailed data, perhaps derived from SEC 10-K disclosures of asset acquisitions and retirements, may be required to circumvent this problem and to provide an improved basis for future inflation accounting research.},
