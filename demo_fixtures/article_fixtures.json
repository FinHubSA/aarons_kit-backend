    "title": "Wagner and Paris: The Case of Rienzi (1869)",
    "abstract": "The French reception of Wagner is often based on the two pillars of the 1861 Tannhäuser production and that of Lohengrin in 1891. Sufficient is now known about the composer's earliest attempt to engage with Parisian music drama around 1840 to be able to understand his work on Das Liebesverbot, Rienzi, Der fliegende Holländer, his editorial and journalistic work for Schlesinger, and his emerging relationship with key figures in Parisian musical life, Meyerbeer most notably. A clearer picture is also beginning to emerge of Wagner's position in French cultural life and letters in the 1850s. Wagner's position in Paris during the 1860s, culminating in the production of Rienzi at the Théâtre-Lyriquein 1869, is however complex, multifaceted, and little understood. Although there were no staged versions of his operas between 1861 and 1869, the very existence of a successful Parisian premiere for an opera by Wagner in 1869—given that there would be almost nothing for two decades after 1870—is remarkable in itself. The 1860s furthermore saw the emergence of a coherent voice of Wagnérisme, the presence of French Wagnéristesat the composer's premieres all over Europe and a developing discourse in French around them. This may be set against a continuing tradition of performing extracts of Wagner's operas throughout the 1860s, largely through the energies of Jules Pasdeloup, who—as director of the Théâtre-Lyrique—was responsible for the 1869 Rienzi as well. These competing threads in the skein of Wagnerreception in the 1860s are tangled in a narrative of increasingly tense Franco-German cultural and political relationships in which Wagner, his works, and his writings, played a key role. The performance of Rienzi in 1869 was embedded in responses to the Prussian-Austrian War of 1866, the republication of Das Judenthum in der Musik in 1869, and the beginnings of the Franco-Prussian War.",

    "title": "The Southern Slope of Monsalvat: How Spanish Wagnerism Became Catalan",
    "abstract": "This article examines the development of Wagnerism in late-nineteenth-century Spain, focusing on how it became an integral part of Catalan nationalism. The reception of Wagner's music and ideas in Spain was determined by the country's uneven economic development and the weakness of its musical and political institutions—the same weaknesses that were responsible for the rise of Catalan nationalism. Lack of a symphonic culture in Spain meant that audiences were not prepared to comprehend Wagner's complexity, but that same complexity made Wagner's ideas acceptable to Spanish reformers who saw in the composer an exemplar of the European ideas needed to fix Spanish problems. Thus, when Wagner's operas were first staged in Spain, the Teatro Real de Madrid stressed Wagner's continuity with operas of the past; however, critics and audiences engaged with the works as difficult forms of modern music. The rejection of Wagner in the Spanish capital cleared the way for his ideas to be adopted in Catalonia. A similar dynamic occurred as Spanish composers tried to meld Wagner into their attempts to build a nationalist school of opera composition. The failure of Tomás Bréton's Los amantes de Teruel and Garín cleared the way for Felip Pedrell's more successful theoretical fusion of Wagnerism and nationalism. While Pedrell's opera Els Pirineus was a failure, his explanation of how Wagner's ideals and nationalism could be fused in the treatise Por nuestra música cemented the link between Catalan culture and Wagnerism.",

    "title": "Ernest Chausson's Viviane, \"Déwagnérisation,\" and the Problem of Descriptive Music",
    "abstract": "Ernest Chausson made two major aesthetic decisions in the mid-1880s: he resolved to \"dewagnerize\" himself and declared that he would no longer write program music. These developments were coeval with Chausson's revisions of Viviane (composed 1882–83, revised 1887 and 1893), a symphonic poem that shares musical material and subject matter with the composer's magnum opus, Le Roi Arthus (1886–95). Drawing on unpublished sketches and manuscripts of Viviane, I trace how Chausson's evolving aesthetics manifested themselves in his revisions of the work. While he suppressed evidence of Wagnerian mimicry, the process of \"dewagnerization\" was equivocal; Viviane ultimately became more beholden to certain Wagnerian dramaturgical ideals. At the same time, Chausson brought Viviane more closely in line with sonata procedures, inviting the listener to appreciate the work on its purely sonic merits at a time when the composer was becoming less sympathetic to the idea of \"descriptive music.\" I conclude by discussing the connections between Viviane and Le Roi Arthus and exploring how Chausson's reuse of material from the symphonic poem sheds light on issues of influence and signification in the opera.",

    "title": "Mixed Doubles: Debussy, Nijinsky, Jeux",
    "abstract": "Pierre Boulez, in his characteristic oracular fashion, once declared the ballet Jeux to be \"a sort of Afternoon of a Faune in sports clothes.\" In this article, I contend that his pithy observation—characterizing the difference between Faune and Jeux in sartorial terms—has diverted historians ever since from asking the right questions about the later work. I examine belle epoque tennis culture to argue that the ballet's disjunct expressive registers—a diaphanous, cerebral score coexisting with sportive, avant-garde choreography—have their roots in belle époque social anxieties about what it meant to be appropriately masculine, but they also foreshadow the problematic place of danced works in current musicological scholarship.",

    "title": "Disrupting the Genre: Unforeseen Personifications in Chopin",
    "abstract": "Abstract What George Sand characterized as the prevalence of “the unforeseen” in Chopin's music can be understood as his programmatic predilection. Within works whose generic titles promise nothing programmatic, he regularly introduces disruptions that announce a previously unsuspected persona in whose mind the music continues to unfold even as that persona brings the premises of the genre under scrutiny. In the Waltz in A♭, op. 42, for instance, a momentary interruption of the waltz beat, like the terminal interruption of the nocturne texture in the Nocturne in B, op. 32, no. 1, produces an ending that tests the capacity of the genre to absorb what most undermines it. In that Nocturne there is a second personifying tension between the genre-establishing texture of singing lines and the genre-challenging daubs of inconsistent damper-pedal coloring, drawing attention to the hand of the composer at work and therefore—if we adopt the insight of Chopin's artistic interlocutor Eugène Delacroix—to his thinking presence. The Mazurka in C Minor, op. 56, no. 3, represents a reverse strategy. There an imagining mind is personified from the beginning, restlessly searching through a catalog of mazurka features, and it is only in the coda, when the music settles into its genre as dance music, that the persona—the element of the unforeseen—retreats.",

    "title": "Chopin's “Duets”—and Mine",
    "abstract": "Abstract Beginning with a personal account of my early experiences of Chopin's B-Minor Prelude and A-Minor Waltz, I argue that “musical meaning” arises neither simply from the music itself nor simply from a listener's or performer's self projections into the music. Instead it arises intersubjectively, from a relationship that subsumes a musical self and a musical other within the virtual (i.e., imaginary or fictional) environment that fully engaged musical experience engenders. Such an intersubjective exchange is likely to be especially acute in the compositional process itself, as the composer creates through music an “other” in dialogue with his or her self. The actual relationship between this other and the composer's own character and experience is rarely possible to ascertain with any degree of certainty: the music is better understood as self-creation than as self-representation. But paradoxically, pieces that are somehow atypical for their composer sometimes epitomize that composer's musical character most strongly and can suggest autobiographical motivation more specifically than many of the composer's other works. Such is the case with Chopin's relatively few solo pieces that suggest vocal duets, whether straightforwardly, as in the C#-Minor Étude, op. 25, no. 7, or through marked contrast with a solo voice, as in the two op. 27 Nocturnes. In each of these pieces, Chopin explores a problematic relationship between two “others,” one of them unattainable or elusive. If one of them mirrors Chopin's musical self, perhaps the other, the more remote, can be understood as a musical image of the self that Chopin needed to develop in order to negotiate the “real world.”",

    "title": "Chopin's Ghosts",
    "abstract": "Abstract Chopin's Stuttgart diary, written in a state of fear for his loved ones after the defeat of the anti-Russian insurrection in fall 1831, reveals the exiled composer's emotional distress and morbid alienation. Chopin's intense feelings of mourning lent his imagination a peculiar fascination with the morbid. References to corpses and allusions to ghosts in the diary reflect a profound trauma caused by the uncertainty of his personal situation and his awareness of the political crisis. The Stuttgart crisis is only one of numerous instances in which Chopin mapped his personal losses onto the broader fate of those Poles forced into exile after the failure of the uprising. This identification with the estranged community was capable of producing a deeply subjective experience of haunting. Chopin's music carries a poignant relationship to loss and melancholia, exemplified in this article by the Étude, op. 10, no. 12 (“Revolutionary”), the Nocturne, op. 15, no. 3, and the Funeral March from the Piano Sonata, op. 35. These traits have prompted recent films by Andrzej Zulawski and Zbig Rybczynski to adopt Chopin's music as a means of collective mourning in post-Communist Poland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Among Chopin's numerous musical identities is that of an important mid-nineteenth-century social type, the dandy: the young man of fashion characterized by a devotion to artifice and a fractious political energy masked by elegant mannerisms. This article seeks to ground the aesthetic of three of Chopin's later Mazurkas (the op. 59 set) in the cult of the dandy, especially as described by Charles Baudelaire; to identify the musical means Chopin devised to realize that aesthetic, namely the “rogue pitches” of my title; and to illustrate how these rogue pitches and the persona of the dandy inflect Chopin's later style.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article views Chopin's Mazurka in C# Minor, op. 30, no. 4, as akin to a dream that is open to analysis from a Lacanian perspective. After a discussion of Jacques Lacan's famous orders of subjectivity (the imaginary, the symbolic order, and the Real), the article turns to his idea that a symptom is a message from the Real that demands interpretation. As such, strange moments in Chopin's Mazurka are like symptoms that require multiple interpretations in order to approach their hidden and overlapping meanings. The article proceeds to view Chopin's Mazurka through nineteenth-century notions of Orientalism (alterity), nationalism (nostalgia), coming to life (the automaton), tuberculosis (the boundary of life and death), and the uncanny (fragmentation of the body/mind). But just as Lacan argued that we can never reach a final meaning for a symptom, the article concludes that there can be no transcendental signified for the various symptomatic moments in Chopin's Mazurka. In the end, the Mazurka becomes what Lacan calls a sinthome, a form of subjectivity that is made up of the very symptoms that the subject strives to understand.",

    "title": "Auber's Horses: L'Annee terrible and Apocalyptic Narratives",
    "abstract": "On 13 May 1871 Auber died. His passing was blamed on the horrors of the Franco-Prussian War, Siege and Commune, and provided a powerful symbol of the end of an era. Indeed, the idea that the debacle of 1870-71 caused a rupture in French music, one embodied in Auber's death, continues to influence music histories; political events are thought to mark a clear turning point away from the operettas of the Second Empire to the more serious works associated with the Third Republic. This notion of a turning point has much to recommend it, but the accepted history may ultimately be better viewed as an example of an apocalyptic narrative; after the event, the infamous frivolity of Napoleon III's era was seen to have led, inexorably, to defeat in the War, and to steep cultural change. I argue that this narrative was retrospectively constructed by contemporary music critics dissatisfied with existing French musical culture. The siege, the Commune, and the \"timely\" death of Auber were used as a means of bolstering demands for change: if the nation were to recover, she would have to change her ways, musical and otherwise. This constructed narrative obscures the picture suggested by primary sources; that not only had changes begun before the war, but that light-hearted forms continued to flourish afterward. It is clearly a narrative in need of historical revision.",

    "title": "Deconstructing d'Indy, or the Problem of a Composer's Reputation",
    "abstract": "Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries in turn-of-the-century France, the composer Vincent d'Indy fashioned an identity based on opposition. Understanding the dynamic of oppositional politics, he defined himself, his music, and the music school he directed, the Schola Cantorum, through difference. This has led both his successors and his critics up through the present to associate him with defiant ultra-conservatism. However, d'Indy was also a man of alliances, alliances that served the composer and the state well. In \"Deconstructing d'Indy,\" I throw into question the attitudes that have accumulated about him and suggest a more nuanced view of the man and his politics based on his practices, particularly before 1900. I show how he allowed government officials to use his difference to help them combat monopolies and bridge conflict with the Republic. The article argues that in misconstruing the nature and function of political differences in France and their relationship to reputation-building strategies, we risk substituting ideology and our own projections of its meaning for a composer's identity and importance in his or her times.",

    "abstract": "The second performance of Debussy's String Quartet, given by the Ysaye Quartet on an all-Debussy program during the 1894 salon of \"La Libre EsthŽtique\" in Brussels, offers an ideal context for a critical reexamination of his musical and aesthetic affinities at this pivotal moment. In the first place, a view to the salon's other three concerts, which honored Beethoven alongside recent works by Societe Nationale composers, encourages reconsideration of Debussy's own response to the \"great tradition\" in the work he ironically designated \"Opus 10.\" But at the same time, due regard to his other contemporaneous compositional obsessions, as exemplified in the works programmed alongside the Quartet, raises the question as to how such self-conscious dialogue with Classical models related to more pressing, post-Wagnerian musical negotiations. Pursuit of this question through analysis of the first movement's reconfigured sonata form ultimately suggests ways to distinguish, from amid the myriad post-Impressionist artists on view in the \"Free Aesthetic\" salon itself, those painters whose visual explorations most tellingly paralleled Debussy's own \"games\" with musical syntax and expression in the early 1890s.",

    "title": "Parisian Cake Walks",
    "abstract": "The popularity of the cake walk among Parisians in the early 1900s is usually attributed to the dance's assumed racial signification. Scholars have argued that the cake walk, owing to its African American origins, was welcomed by Parisians as iconic of a racial \"other,\" a signifier of the primitive, uncultured, and grotesque. This article proposes an alternative reading, setting the standard scholarly line against other, more subtle impressions of the cake walk's cultural import. A consideration of popular response to the dance--on stage, on film, and in the circus arena--reveals Parisian tastes not only for distinct styles of gesture but for American chic, athleticism, and popular participation, as well as the world of the \"other.\" These connotations invite us to consider afresh what is perhaps the most celebrated cake walk of the period, Debussy's \"Golliwogg's cake walk\" (1908), known particularly for its quotation of Wagner's Tristan. Debussy's piece, I argue, has a more complex significance than that of a mere canvas on which to poke fun at Wagner or a straightforward reference to a minstrel doll. By means of various cultural and aesthetic nuances, it suggests a persona shaped by buffoonery, slapstick, despondency, and irony: in short, a persona identified with that fetish of modernist art, the clown.",

    "title": "High Anxiety: New Venues, New Audiences, and the Fear of the Popular in Late Imperial Russian Musical Life",
    "abstract": "Abstract Russia's social and economic transformation at the beginning of the twentieth century was accompanied by profound cultural and artistic transformation. In particular, Russian cultural elites struggled to control and contain what they saw as threats to Russia's national culture. At the same time, however, they sought ways to bring the working classes into a closer cultural accord with educated society. Although these efforts continued a long process of intelligentsia efforts to shape Russian society by controlling the development of “the people,” industrialization and urbanization had already begun to fundamentally restructure the relationship between the educated and popular classes. In musical life, the intelligentsia struggled with two somewhat contradictory impulses: first, to simultaneously protect musical and song traditions from the threat of contamination by new urban genres; and second, to develop “rational recreations” that would appeal to the peasantry and the urban working classes. To those ends, they created, among other activities, accessible (obshchedostupnyi) concerts, temperance choirs, and singing classes in a wide variety of locations across the Russian Empire. These musical projects were part of a much larger, somewhat utopian effort by educated society to create an ideal Russia by eliminating its supposed social, cultural, economic, and political backwardness relative to Western Europe. Nevertheless, the consequences for Russian musical life proved significant. Not only did these efforts lay the moral and intellectual foundation for Soviet-era interventionist and utopian cultural policies, but they also in the short term significantly diversified and democratized musical life in the last decades of tsarist rule.",

    "title": "A Ukrainian Tune in Medieval France: Perceptions of Nationalism and Local Color in Russian Opera",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article is based on the key-note lecture given at the conference “Non-Nationalist” Russian Operas, Leeds, U.K., on 17 November 2010. It engages with the conference's distinction between the “nationalist” and “non-nationalist” and proposes six potential situations for when an opera might be described as “Russian”: by composer's intention, by reception, by interpretation, by association, by blood or culture, and by emanating from the nationalist school. Given that these six categories of Russianness (some of them mystificatory) form a network of conflicting claims upon any opera, there is no straightforward method for assigning operas to Russian or non-Russian categories. Therefore an alternative approach is proposed: to revive the older concept of “local color,” which figured prominently in nineteenth-century Russian discourse on opera, and to use this as a lens through which almost any nineteenth-century Russian opera can instructively be viewed. After examining how the concept was understood by leading Russian critics, Serov and Cui, the author offers a selection of her own examples to elucidate the use of “Russian” local color. It is emphasized that there are certain limits beyond which this color cannot be applied: characters of noble birth, even when Russian, are rarely portrayed in Russian colors; scenes that take place outside Russia usually have their own, appropriate color, e.g., “Polish” or “Oriental”; most importantly, themes that are considered universal, such as love or death, are usually exempt from Russian coloring. Examples from the late operas of Rimsky-Korsakov demonstrate his conscious and sometimes obsessive efforts in creating appropriate colors, Russian and otherwise. This approach allows us to set aside preconceived notions of which composers were truly national, especially when we generalize that local color denotes any distinguishing device designed to evoke a specific time and place, as well as the social identity of a character. Thus Tchaikovsky's operas, often criticized for their lack of “Russianness,” display a subtle understanding of appropriate coloring: Eugene Onegin, for example, uses an idiom based on the parlor song of the Russian gentry, while The Queen of Spades takes up eighteenth-century idioms—in both cases lending the drama an appropriate color. The article concludes that local color, a much-used device in nineteenth-century opera across Europe, was an almost obligatory requirement for Russian opera composers who adopted an aesthetic of the characteristic, along the lines proposed by Victor Hugo in his Preface to Cromwell. The concept proves to be a valuable critical tool that allows us to deal with nineteenth-century Russian opera without becoming ensnared in essentializing distinctions between “nationalist” and “non-nationalist.” At the same time, it allows us to put Russian color in perspective, as one color among many cultivated by opera composers.",

    "title": "Unfinished Considerations: Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony in the Context of His Beethoven Project",
    "abstract": "Schubert finished only the first two movements of his B-Minor Symphony (D. 759), and they remained unseen and unheard for the last six years of his life, indeed until 1865. The best available evidence indicates that he sent his only score to the Music Society in Graz sometime after September 1823, and that from that point on, at the latest, he had given up any plans to complete the two remaining movements. But why? At least part of the answer is to be found in several consistent patterns Schubert followed in the conduct of his career. He did not return to unfinished works after he had laid them aside for a period of several months; the only exception to this pattern is the Mass in Ab. And not until early 1824 did Schubert begin to seek publication or public performance for newly composed works in the large multi-movement instrumental genres--in Beethoven's genres. Finally, in October 1822, the date on the score of the B-Minor Symphony, Schubert could have had no reasonable expectation of a full performance of a four-movement symphony, in Vienna or anywhere else, by an orchestra of adequate quality. His subsequent hopes and exertions for a performance of a symphony, for his \"Great\" C-Major Symphony, proved illusory and unavailing, even after he had become much better established.",

The materials hail from the French baritone Victor Maurel (1848-1923), Verdi's first Iago and first Falstaff, and from his second wife, the musical theater librettist and screenwriter Frederique Rosine de Gresac (1866/7-1943). The letters and other sources constitute an important resource for not only nineteenth-century opera and operatic performance but also the early American musical, film studies, the history of women, even the history of celebrity. The Verdi letters concern Maurel's creation of the role of Falstaff and include a intriguing debate about preparing for the role and singing generally.",

    "title": "Within Sight: Three-Dimensional Perspectives on Women and Banjos in the Late Nineteenth Century",
    "abstract": "During the last decades of the nineteenth century, women figured prominently in a marketing campaign by banjo manufacturers who sought to make the banjo a respectable instrument for ladies. Their overarching aim was to \"elevate\" the banjo's status from its African-American and minstrel-show associations, thereby making the instrument acceptable in white bourgeois society. At the same time, stereoview cards, three-dimensional photographs produced by the millions, were a popular parlor entertainment featuring a variety of contemporary images, including women playing the banjo. Yet, instead of depicting a genteel lady in the parlor playing her beribboned banjo, the stereoviews presented humorous and sometimes risque scenes of banjo-playing women. Further, virtually no stereoviews exist that show the banjo played by a lady in a parlor setting. Through a study of stereoscopic depictions of women in a variety of scenes, I place these unexpected images of women's music-making in a context that explains their significance. In particular I examine the way stereoviews provide insights about the tensions regarding the position and status of women in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American culture as revealed in the figure of the New Woman. Typical of constructions of this threatening figure, stereographic images picture the New Woman wearing bloomers, riding bicycles, attending college, smoking, neglecting her wifely duties and children, and even indulging in lesbian eroticism. Yet, stereoviews are distinctive in that they also show the New Woman playing the banjo, and I argue that the link between the banjo and the New Woman had a decisive and negative impact on the effectiveness of the banjo elevation project. Through an examination of these three-dimensional views, and drawing on late-nineteenth-century writing and poetry about the banjo, I show how the banjo in the hands of the New Woman became a cautionary cultural icon for middle- and upper-class women, subverting the respectable image of the parlor banjo and the bourgeois women who played it. I place this new evidence in the context of Karen Linn's paradigm describing the banjo elevation project as one that sought to shift the banjo from the realm of sentimental values to official values. The figure of the New Woman does not fit within Linn's dichotomy; rather, she falls outside both sets of values. Often viewed as a third sex herself, in a sense mirroring the gender tensions surrounding the banjo, the New Woman helped to shift the banjo into a third realm, that of revolutionary and perhaps even decadent values. This study enhances what we know about the way musical instruments have been used to reconfigure attitudes toward gender roles in the popular imagination and furthers our understanding of the complex role women have played in the history of the banjo. Moreover, this evidence demonstrates how gender and sexuality can affect the reception of music, and musical instruments, through powerful iconographic images.",

    "title": "Elektra's Oceanic Time: Voice and Identity in Richard Strauss",
    "abstract": "Perhaps more than any other opera by Strauss, Elektra is a drama about the sense of hearing. It belongs to the phantasmagoric realm of listening, and it affirms, like few other operas, the power of music alone to fire up the listener's imagination. In this sense, it renders the transitions between its own different layers of reality, between the here and now of Elektra's agony and her reliving of her father's murder at the hands of her mother and her mother's lover, in a way that obscures the borderline between that terrible past and the soon to be horrible present. The article investigates these transitions in the opera. The crime against her father, Agamemnon, has burned itself into her soul, and it directs all her experience afterward. Elektra's retribution of the past injustice is no more than an imagined restoration. Her revenge remains a private matter; it does not resurrect any moral order and does not re-create the basis for a new community. The radicalism of this lack of morality is overwhelming, especially if we consider that Hofmannsthal's libretto departs from Sophocles only on this main point. A different notion of time, articulated through Strauss's music, strikes through the ongoing present, takes hold of it, and becomes predominant. This is the time in which Elektra lives. We witness a strange battle between remembrance and forgetting as Elektra's present actions are driven wholly by the effort to forget the present in order to restore the past. All is in vain, of course, because it is impossible to reverse time. Everything is too late. This belatedness becomes Elektra's destiny. Directors often lean heavily on Elektra's resolution of her predicament in the fulfillment of full-blown revenge, which ends with a going out of time at the very moment when the border between lived real time and fantasy time collapses. Yet what if emphasis were placed elsewhere? The article raises this question as a pressing one, in connection with Peter Konwitschny's staging of Elektra in the new theater of the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen, February 2005. In Konwitschny's staging, the decisive event, the precipitating trauma, is no longer, as in Strauss and Hofmannsthal, something that has long since happened when the curtain rises and that rules every succeeding event from an inaccessible point in past time. Instead, the precipitating trauma is drawn into the opera itself. The article tries to show how this interpretation has consequences that change the work. Elektra's destiny does not become less shocking, but rather shocks us in a different manner.",

    "title": "Local Color: Donizetti's Il furioso in Naples",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the furore aroused by Il furioso's simultaneous triple Neapolitan premiere in 1834. Situating the opera's unusual reception in the context of the complex and vibrant theatrical life of Naples, I describe how the coexistence of multiple versions of Il furioso—prose as well as operatic—inflected the meanings of Donizetti's work. Close attention is paid to the opera's interaction with local performance traditions, notably those obtaining in the city's less prestigious venues, where factors such as the permeability of the “fourth wall” brought the work into dialogue with local urban preoccupations. After considering the close parallels between the buffo slave Kaidamà (played blackface) and Pulcinella, the stock Neapolitan mask, I demonstrate how aspects of Kaidamà's representation unnervingly recalled the class of urban beggars (lazzaroni) that personified Neapolitan backwardness. At the hands of local conventions, Donizetti's work took on a form that, by evoking pervasive discourses of Southern inferiority, raised uncomfortable questions about Neapolitan self-image. The contingent and unpredictable meanings thrown up by Il furioso's reception suggest the potential importance of vernacular performance traditions as a line of future research.",

    "title": "Saint Elsewhere: German and English Reactions to Mendelssohn's Paulus",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines German and English reactions to Felix Mendelssohn's 1836 oratorio, Paulus. German Protestant audiences recognized Paulus's devotional, or spiritual, quality, which derived from its incorporation of well-known Lutheran chorales. In using chorales and reflective arias and choruses, Mendelssohn followed the model established by Johann Sebastian Bach in his St. Matthew Passion, a work that Mendelssohn had reintroduced to German audiences in 1829. When Paulus was premiered for English audiences in a translation called St. Paul, it was enthusiastically received. But these audiences misunderstood St. Paul's devotional elements, for several reasons. Not only were English audiences unfamiliar with both Bach's music and the Lutheran chorale, they also expected oratorios to follow the model established by Handel. As such, English audiences were confused by those places in St. Paul where the present-day audience is called to reflect and attempted to attribute these numbers to characters in the drama. Mendelssohn responded to this confusion when writing his next oratorio, Elias (or Elijah), in which he hewed more closely to the Handelian model.",

    "title": "Après une Lecture de Liszt: Virtuosity and Werktreue in the “Dante” Sonata",
    "abstract": "Abstract The European press of the late 1830s indicates a glaring disparity between Liszt's questionable status as a composer and his eminence as a virtuoso performer. The staggered compositional history of one particular piano work, Après une lecture du Dante—Fantasie quasi Sonata (1839–58), straddles this schism uniquely in that it bridged two distinct periods of Liszt's life: the Glanzzeit of immensely successful European concert tours, and the predominantly compositional span as Kapellmeister in Weimar. As such, it documents the mise-en-scène of Liszt's self-fashioned metamorphosis from virtuoso to composer. As a work borne expressly of improvisational acts, the “Dante” Sonata exhibits paradoxical traits that bind it to both performance and compositional traditions. Through a study of Carl Czerny's influence on Liszt, and the latter's own improvisational practices, I take a medium-sensitive approach to the “Dante” Sonata by interrogating the historical concept of Phantasieren as part of a rereading of the compositional technique of thematic transformation. Based on the excised material from the extant manuscripts, I reconstruct the genesis of the “Dante” Sonata and chart its compositional history and generic evolution. A comparative presentation of selected revisions, alternatives, and variants from the work illustrates the problematic juncture between improvisation and composition, the extent to which self-borrowing and the interchangeability of texts raise questions about our modern work-concept, the notion of a musical text, and the functions of performance within a text.",

    "title": "Ambiguous Speech and Eloquent Silence: The Queerness of Tchaikovsky's Songs",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article considers a number of Tchaikovsky's songs—specifically those with texts by Apukhtin, Romanov, Heine, Goethe, and Tchaikovsky himself—to explore how silence constitutes a powerful yet elusive form of expression. It argues that Tchaikovsky's songs, an underappreciated and underexplored aspect of his output (at least in the West), are characterized by a degree of literary and musical sophistication seldom attributed to the composer. Their self-consciousness is held to be the product of a combination of three main social and aesthetic forces characteristic of Russian culture in the second half of the nineteenth century. Drawing first on the work of Bakhtin, the article argues that the nature of Tchaikovsky's songs as lyric forms in an age dominated by the realist novel invests them with a creative tension between the need to conceal (an imperative inherited from the lyric poetry of the 1820s and 1830s) and the need to reveal (a feature of the novel's tendency to intimacy and confession). Then, turning to the work of Foucault, it traces how a coherent discourse of homosexual identity (as opposed to an otherwise unrelated series of individual homosexual acts) arose in the later nineteenth century, forcing queer artists to address (whether consciously or otherwise) the question of how best to relate this identity to their creativity. Finally, it looks at the evolving status of the artist in late Imperial Russia and suggests that an uneasy relationship between revealing and concealing was imposed upon personalities in the public eye by an audience that wished to feel close to the artist, yet also required discretion and the avoidance of scandal. At the heart of the article lies a study of silence as a particularly expressive form of apparent non-expression, dealing with frequent instances in Tchaikovsky's songs of silence as a poetic trope, as well as with equivocation on matters of gender and identity in lyric forms as indicative of a potentially queer sensibility. Also, the article refuses to reimpose a categorically and reductively homosexual reading, posited on some presumed opposed heterosexual norm. Rather, it argues that Tchaikovsky was able to discern the peculiar appeal of lyric forms as referentially incomplete yet aesthetically self-sufficient fragments, and that he approached such lyrics in a way that emphasized qualities of ambiguity, allusion, and the uncanny. Although drawing extensively on literary models, the article also considers how music is paradoxically well placed to enact poetic silence. The relationship between words and music, and between composition, performance, and reception, is a further instance of how song became an apt medium in which the thoughtful composer could explore issues of personal and creative identity in an age of profound artistic and social transformation.",

    "title": "Exposed: Adorno and Schubert in 1928",
    "abstract": "In this close reading of the first page of Adorno's \"Schubert,\" one aim is to highlight the sheer intensity of Adorno's literary ambition, generating a visual poetics that contributes to the text's striking, and daunting, narrative complexity. With reference to the French poet Louis Aragon, Adorno situates Schubert within a distinctly surrealist landscape--a strategic move that is rhetorically as provocative as it is hermeneutically and methodologically risky. I briefly follow up some of this modernist imagery in Schubert's Winterreise, envisioned here as a nondevelopmental, glacial compositional canvas across which the wanderer wanders with a single idea in mind, forever repeated in subtle variations, affecting atmosphere (Stimmung) but not essence: in Winterreise, as Adorno's text suggests, the mind is lost in its own idea, accommodating the pre-human or post-human experience: life-in-death in the midst of an apocalyptic landscape. A second aim of this paper is to respond to Adorno's stylistic provocation: do we need poetry in music criticism, or indeed criticism as poetry? Do we need allegories of death and Utopian landscapes to talk about music? As will be argued, \"Schubert\" is a text whose author does not deny that his subject matter--Schubert--is, in fact, wholly fictional. Moreover, as Adorno goes on to describe Winterreise as a journey in search of an inner, and de-centered, self, and as we see this journey slowly unfold before our eyes, it becomes more than usually apparent that Adorno's true subject matter is the admission and expression of emotion. With great poetic acumen, his pen traces like a seismograph the rhythmic pulsations and shockwaves traversing Schubert's landscape. Adorno's essay begins with a fully imagined and powerfully articulated landscape, and as he goes on to render \"Schubert's landscape\" visible, his text takes on a geography that informs us about the structure of the very selves it describes: first Schubert's; then Adorno's; and finally, possibly, our own.",

This is related to Adorno's attitude toward organicism, characterized by a critique that was relevant on both the political and the theoretical level. His antiorganicist vision of Schubert's music is compared to the nationalist stance of a Richard Benz, typical of right-wing readings of German cultural greatness, and also to the analytical a prioris of two pupils of Schenker, Felix Salzer and Otto Vrieslander (as shown in their perception of the exposition of the Bb-Major Sonata). Finally, Adorno's attitude toward Schubert is related to his commitment on behalf of a \"Schoenbergian politics,\" which led him to view both Schoenberg's and Schubert's music as an alternative to a musical canon shaped by a shared belief in organicism.",

    "title": "Landscape as Music, Landscape as Truth: Schubert and the Burden of Repetition",
    "abstract": "Adorno's essay on Schubert opens by invoking a fraught move across the threshold that separates the death of Beethoven from the death of Schubert. He goes on to read Schubert's music through a series of dichotomies whose opposite terms are distinctly Beethovenian: Schubert's themes are self-possessed apparitions of truth rather than inchoate ideas that require temporal evolution; his repetitive, fragmentary forms are inorganic rather than organic, crystalline rather than plantlike. Above all, Adorno develops the idea that Schubert's music offers the repeatable truth of a landscape rather than the processive trajectory of a teleological history. Schubert's themes, like landscapes, are forms of permanence that cannot be fundamentally altered but can only be revisited. With special emphasis on Schubert's G-Major String Quartet, this article inflects Adorno's view of Schubert's landscapes by considering how these \"truths\" also present themselves as illusory and inward (e.g., how some of Schubert's thematic areas can be heard to project a visionary interior space in the way that they suddenly introduce a markedly different realm or the way that they obliquely inhabit their tonal centers). It is then argued that Schubert's music is thus steeped in an existential consciousness for which subjectivity is the only knowable truth. And this truth bears repeating, in the double sense that it can be repeated and it must be repeated.",

    "abstract": "AdornoÕs view of Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy is of flawed music. He regards the finale as yet another compositionally disastrous failure by Schubert to know how to round off a sonata or symphony. But he is clearly intrigued by the slow movement's acts of negation and alienation. This article investigates these two crises. First, what is actually--if one may dare ask such a thing--wrong with the finale? That it is all empty mock-fugue and sequence and passage-work? And thus it lacks truth-content? That Schubert is not really composing this finale; it is somehow composing him? Here I investigate analytically what Adorno's \"temporal series of atemporal cells\" means. Second, how does the slow movement move us from lightness into despair? Death for Schubert, Adorno tells us, is not about pain, but mourning, something Schubert takes us right inside--or to use Adorno's image, through a portal to the underworld (29). I believe that this landscape is also nested within the slow movement of the Wanderer Fantasy. If, as always with variations, the task of the analyst is not so clear here, the task of the (rightly) evidence-bound hermeneut probably is.",

    "abstract": "Adorno's \"Schubert\" textually reenacts what he recognizes in Schubert's music, repeating himself but with subtle differences, as though he were holding up a cut gem to light and turning it to see the differences manifested in its facets. Adorno's ideas about this music are less developed than juxtaposed, often paratactically, so as to constitute what Benjamin termed a constellation. What Adorno hears in Schubert is a kind of reciprocity toward otherness. Schubert's \"landscape,\" for Adorno, is grounded in the realm of the cultural imaginary; it represents for him a declaration of love, defined by the difference between subject and object that engenders embrace, rather than domination. The aesthetic truth of Schubert's music doesn't emerge through development, except, ironically perhaps, in the \"successful\" failure of his developments. Instead, it's articulated in a virtual instant, as in the shape and turn of a melody (and distinctly not in its working out).The Schubert melody is like the imagined perfection of landscape--as though, like \"nature,\" it were always already complete. The C-minor Andante of the Piano Trio in Eb (op. 100, D. 929) is a case in point. The opening melodic statement in the cello and the folklike second theme in the violin, for the most part, can only be repeated, not improved upon, though Schubert tries--the melodic perfection of the opening statements, the first theme especially, becomes unambiguously evident only when the movement ends. We need everything that follows the initial statements to realize what we first heard: a melody (more than a theme) complete in itself, perfect, and on that account acoustically utopian--a semblance of happiness embedded in the sad honesty of C-minorÕs pensive melancholy.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on published and unpublished sources, this article traces the changing ways in which Schoenberg made his sketches, fragments, and the creative process in general integral aspects of both his identity as a composer and the reception of his music. One side of this story is Schoenberg's well-known concern for how posterity would view him, evident in his obsession with demonstrating his stature as a genius and defining his place in history as the first to break with tonality and as the inventor of \"the method of composing with twelve tones related only to one another.\" But as significant for the present context are the ways that, beginning in the first decade of the century, he started to make his Nachlass known through the dissemination of manuscripts, sketches, and fragments, and by means of discussions of the creative process and compositional techniques in his voluminous writings. Schoenberg's interjection of the act of composition into public musical discourse has clear origins in the nineteenth century, but it also has important implications for the blurring of boundaries between the work, the creative process, the artist, and the audience, a characteristic of twentieth- and twenty-first-century art and now a fundamental feature of our cultural life.",

    "title": "Feminist Revolutionary Music Criticism and Wagner Reception: The Case of Louise Otto",
    "abstract": "Abstract Histories of progressive musical politics in mid-nineteenth-century Germany often center on the writings of Richard Wagner and Franz Brendel, relegating contributors such as the feminist and author Louise Otto (1819–95) to the periphery. However, Otto's lifelong engagement with music, including her two librettos, two essay collections on the arts, and numerous articles and feuilletons, demonstrates how one contemporary woman considered the progressive movements in music and in women's rights to be interrelated. A staunch advocate of Wagner, Otto contributed to numerous music journals, as well as her own women's journal, advising her female readers to engage with the music of the New German School. In the context of the middle-class women's movement, she saw music as a space for female advancement through both performance and the portrayals of women onstage. Her writings offer us a glimpse into the complex network of Wagner proponents who also supported women's rights, at the same time providing evidence for what some contemporary conservative critics saw as a concomitant social threat from both Wagnerian musical radicalism and the emancipated woman.",

    "title": "Of Time and the City: Verdi's Don Carlos and Its Parisian Critics",
    "abstract": "Abstract When Don Carlos premiered at the Paris Opéra in March 1867, there was considerable excitement among critics about the prospect of a new work from one of Europe's most famous and popular living composers. In the event, the opera's reception was riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions. The fundamental problem was the work's ambiguous position: as a new grand opera appearing at a time when Parisian operatic culture was centered ever more on old masterpieces. Moreover, the new work's length (although characteristic of its genre) seemed ill suited to performance in Second Empire Paris, where the pace of life was felt to be constantly accelerating. In this article I ask how and why Don Carlos—a work judged by many critics to be the epitome of “modern” Verdi—was so at odds with broader conceptions of Parisian modernity. Focusing particularly on the Act IV Duo between Philip II and the Grand Inquisitor, I explore how aspects of the scene's musical unfolding foreground tensions between an increasingly prominent operatic past and an imagined operatic future. Ultimately, I argue that the opera's reception was saturated with concerns about an emerging phenomenon of “canonic listening”: an ideal encounter with music extending over countless repeated hearings and predicated on the value of sustained, concentrated engagement with a complex musical surface.",

    "title": "Regionalist Frictions in the Bullring: Lyric Theater in Béziers at the Fin de Siècle",
    "abstract": "Abstract Founded by entrepreneur and mélomane Castelbon de Beauxhostes in 1898, the Festival des Arènes de Béziers was an annual festival of lyric theater that featured important premieres by major French composers, including Camille Saint-Saëns, Gabriel Fauré, Henri Rabaud, and Déodat de Séverac. Performances were held in this Mediterranean town's modern, open-air bull-fighting arena and initially featured works inspired by Greek myths that were played in front of audiences that regularly exceeded ten thousand spectators. This article, which draws extensively upon unpublished archival material and contemporaneous press reports, examines the origins, challenges, and decline of this unlikely cultural and musical enterprise. Located far from the center of French theatrical activity, the Béziers festival was implicated in the contentious fin-de-siècle debates over cultural decentralization and regional identity and was criticized from the outset for not sufficiently adopting a regionalist mandate of highlighting local history, culture, and traditions. Further tensions were generated as a result of the contrasting expectations of elite and popular audiences and the concomitant aesthetic issues related to writing works intended to function as mass entertainment. This article argues that the Béziers festival gradually moved away from the elitism associated with modernized Hellenism (featured in the works by Saint-Saëns and Fauré) and gradually programmed works that were ostensibly friendlier to regionalists and local audiences alike (Rabaud and de Séverac). Finally, this article highlights the crucial role of the Félibres, a cultural and political group dedicated to valorizing southern regional identity, in advocating these changes and examines the unique nature of the works performed at Béziers in light of competing theatrical trends of this period.",

    "title": "Musical History and Self-Consciousness in Mendelssohn's Octet, Op. 20",
    "abstract": "Abstract The historical past played perhaps a more important role in Mendelssohn's music than in that of any other composer. This article approaches the work traditionally seen as his first major compositional achievement, the Octet in E♭ Major for Strings, op. 20 (1825), from the perspective of the composer's strong historical sense and takes up ideas of musical memory, history, and circular narrative journey as embodied in the cyclical structure of the piece. The Octet enacts a coming to self-consciousness of its own musical history, a process with close parallels in the writings of Goethe and Hegel, both of whom Mendelssohn knew personally. In its cyclical manipulations of musical time, Mendelssohn's Octet sets up a new formal and expressive paradigm for a musical work that would be of major significance for the instrumental music of the later nineteenth century.",

    "title": "Mother Mime: Siegfried, the Fairy Tale, and the Metaphysics of Sexual Difference",
    "abstract": "Abstract Richard Wagner's Siegfried constitutes something of an anomaly within the Ring cycle: the epic narrative of the Nibelungs and Valsungs grinds to a virtual halt, while two characters, Mime and Siegfried, reenact the fairy tale of the “youth who went forth to learn what fear is.” The fairy tale's mythic framework nevertheless reasserts itself within the fairytale enclosure in the guise of sexuality, in particular sexual difference: As Siegfried begins asking troubling questions about his paternity, Mime is thrust into the role of unitary origin, culminating in his desperate claim that he is Siegfried's “father and mother.” This article explores how exactly Wagner stages the tug of war between Siegfried and Mime over sexual difference, in particular in act I of Siegfried, allying different ways of conceiving descent, knowledge, and love with either the epic or the anti-epic (which Wagner associates with the fairy tale). This turns the generic struggle at the heart of Siegfried into a struggle between two kinds of families laying claim to Siegfried's paternity: the Gods of Valhalla who reproduce sexually, and the Nibelungs who are capable only of asexual reproduction of the self-same. This article argues that Wagner draws on his own speculations on sexuality, race, and history, in particular his idiosyncratic reading of Schopenhauer, to overlay this opposition not only with moral significations, but racial ones as well.",

    "title": "Mystéres limpides: Time and Transformation in Debussy's Des pas sur la neige",
    "abstract": "Abstract Vladimir Jankélévitch heard Debussy's music as a sonic manifestation of certain nuclear mysteries of existence: mysteries of death, destiny, anguish, pleasure, love, space, and—in various forms—time. To describe these mysteries, he developed the paradoxical locution of the mystére limpide, the “lucid mystery.” Debussy's mysteries are lucid, Jankélévitch argued, in that they are not hidden behind arcane codes or hermetic formalisms, but are instead palpably present to experience, sensually manifest in the music's sounding surface. As such, they prove resistant to hermeneutic and analytical attention, which, per Jankélévitch, seek always to penetrate beyond sounding surfaces in search of hidden meanings. This article takes Jankélévitch's ideas as a point of departure in both a positive and negative sense, adopting his notion of the mystére limpide as a valuable heuristic in Debussy study, but challenging his highly limited views of analysis and hermeneutics. The article takes as its focus Debussy's Prélude Des pas sur la neige and explores the ways in which it can be heard to manifest mystéres of time, representation, and consciousness. It does this, however, with the aid of analysis and hermeneutics, drawing on transformational theory, familiar concepts from narratology, and Proustian notions of memory. In short, the article deploys discourses anathema to Jankélévitch for decidedly Jankélévitchian ends. The conclusion explores the degrees to which such a paradoxical effort succeeds, ultimately arguing that discursive intervention—technical or otherwise—need not be a means of seeking out hidden meanings, but can instead be a means of drawing us closer to music as a physical, material phenomenon.",

    "title": "Once More to Mendelssohn's Scotland: The Laws of Music, the Double Tonic, and the Sublimation of Modality",
    "abstract": "Abstract Many of Mendelssohn's letters and statements demonstrate his aversion to any music, including the traditions he encountered on his travels in Scotland and other destinations, when it stood outside certain aesthetic and technical teachings that in his student years he took to heart as universal axioms. Friction becomes evident between this rejection of rule-breaking styles and his Romantic desire to be connected to folk music, furthered by his visual and literary attraction to Scotland particularly. I argue that this cognitive dissonance spurred Mendelssohn to transform folk modality—real and imagined—into a personalized form in his work. A striking example is the “double tonic” effect associated with many Scottish modal melodies: the rapid alternation between outlined triads a whole step apart. Though this tool could potentially create the type of exoticism the composer tried to avoid in his mature work, he nevertheless later adapted the feature to articulate all the main cadential passages of his “Scottish” Symphony's first movement; but he found a way to rework the double tonic's inherent melodic dynamism into harmonic stasis, thus preserving the artistic laws he valued while creating a special sound at the same time. Inflecting some theories by other scholars on Mendelssohn's “Scottish” style(s), I examine how this and his other altered evocations of modality temper or even displace functional harmonic tension, and elements of this style permeate some of the composer's other works to become a topos. Nevertheless, the “Scottish” music, especially the Symphony, is more deeply affected than the other works—reflecting a unique set of circumstances.",

    "title": "The Sociability of History in French Grand Opera: A Historical Materialist Perspective",
    "abstract": "Abstract French grand opera relied heavily on historical sources for its stories, settings, and characters. This article reexamines why representations of the past captivated Parisian audiences. For these spectators, history was not just a purely factual discourse about what happened centuries ago, it was also a social phenomenon. As such, grand opera's appropriation of historical subjects depended on new social spaces formed by new patterns in text production and consumption. When these spaces first emerged, historical grand opera became socially feasible, and as they were transformed, the genre began to wane. Focusing on Auber's La Muette de Portici, this article reconsiders the emergence of historical grand opera in terms of such material conditions of possibility. It then outlines how new material conditions in the middle decades of the nineteenth century reshaped attitudes toward operatic history, drawing on the historical materialist philosophy of Walter Benjamin to clarify the effects of these social and technological changes.",

    "title": "Édouard Dujardin, Wagner, and the Origins of Stream of Consciousness Writing",
    "abstract": "Abstract Édouard Dujardin's novel Les Lauriers sont coupés (1887) has long been acknowledged as an important influence on the stream of consciousness style (called monologue intérieur by Dujardin) found in James Joyce's Ulysses. Dujardin wrote the book during the period he edited the short-lived Revue wagnérienne. The study shows how monologue intérieur was connected to experimental literary trends debated on the pages of the Revue as well as in the Symbolist movement more generally. Two of these trends were vers libre and the construct of an interiorized mental theater, and both were grounded in particular perceptions of Wagnerian opera. Dujardin and his Symbolist colleagues appreciated Wagner's move to abstraction, but thought he had not gone far enough. The article illustrates how putative syntactical freedoms in Wagner's work encouraged vers libre, how a song cycle Dujardin composed to his own vers libre tested the boundaries between literature and music against a Wagnerian backcloth, and how a “paraphrase” of the Amfortas monologue in the first act of Parsifal published in the Revue produced a theater of the mind. The invention of monologue intérieur emerges as a rich and multivalent point of intersection between Wagnerian opera and modernity.",

    "title": "\"There is no anachronism\": Indian Dancing Girls in Ancient Carthage in Berlioz's Les Troyens",
    "abstract": "Abstract Relatively early in the composition of Les Troyens Berlioz declared his intention to include a \"pas d'almées with the music and dancing exactly like the Bayadères' ballet which I saw here sixteen or seventeen years ago.\" Despite Berlioz's claim that he had \"gone into it\" and \"there is no anachronism,\" historical evidence would suggest that the presence of Indian dancing girls in Dido's Carthage is actually highly inauthentic and anachronistic. Indeed, Berlioz's immediate inspiration for the ballet in question was not ancient history but, rather, a group of Indian dancers and musicians who had visited Paris in 1838. An investigation of the context of the bayadères' performances and the reception of the dancers and their music reveals that issues of authenticity and anachronism were a constant preoccupation for their French audiences, most of whom had previously encountered bayadères only through the exoticizing lens of Western representations. Berlioz's own references to the bayadères are examined in relation to contemporary reviews and the text of a highly self-reflexive play that was performed as a prologue and that shaped audiences' responses to the bayadères' performances at the Théâtre des Variétés in Paris. Although Berlioz is generally thought to have abandoned his intention to embody the 1838 bayadères in Les Troyens, I argue that he actually retained aspects of his original Indian inspiration in the act IV ballet; moreover, an awareness of the impact of the bayadères' performances on Berlioz and his contemporaries greatly informs our appreciation of the contribution of the act IV ballet to the wider imperial subtext of Les Troyens. If, rather than simply dismissing anachronism, we are willing to embrace it as a concept fundamental to Berlioz's opera, the act IV ballet—often cut in recent productions—can be newly appreciated as occupying a significant role in the historical dialectic of Les Troyens as a whole.",

    "title": "Flying Leaves: Between Berlioz and Wagner",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyzes the writings of Berlioz on Wagner and, to a lesser extent, of Wagner on Berlioz, emphasizing the covert innuendoes of their verbal sparring during the period surrounding the Tannhäuser debacle at the Paris Opéra (1860) and Berlioz's tribulations with Les Troyens (ca. 1853–63). Because Berlioz's style and subtlety have worked against him in this famous rivalry, the priority goes to him, and especially to his magnum opus as critic, the volume A travers chants (1862). A selection from thirty years of music criticism both serious and light (\"flying leaves\"), A travers chants reveals itself as an unconventional counterpart to Wagner's treatises; as a tactical response to Wagner, both in the reprinted review of his 1860 concerts and in the structure, themes, and allusions of the text as a whole; as an object lesson in reading Berlioz, whose engaging clarity and humor can be more deceptive, in their ironic undertones, than the thickets of Wagner's famously tangled prose. This article interrogates some of that prose, revealing Wagner's deep ambivalence toward a predecessor of intimidating prestige to whom his music is frequently indebted—as Berlioz occasionally finds coded ways of reminding him. It shows Berlioz, for his part, continually sympathetic to the younger man's practical difficulties and high artistic ideals. And it shows him eventually coming to acknowledge the power and legitimacy of his music, despite strong aversion to Wagner's harmonic idiom and to the two cardinal points of his aesthetic: an \"impious\" insistence on the primacy of the word; belief in a musical progress culminating in his own Gesamtkunstwerk. In a late letter wrongly omitted from the Correspondance générale (its authenticity and correct date are here established), Berlioz movingly implies the injustice of his earlier prejudice toward a practice sanctioned by his own unshakeable creed of artistic freedom.",

    "title": "\"Vous qui faites l'endormie\": The Phantom and the Buried Voices of the Paris Opéra",
    "abstract": "Abstract Gaston Leroux's Le Fantôme de l'Opéra (1909–10), as well as providing the model for some famous adaptations in other media, represents an important late stage in the development of a venerable French novelistic tradition: the soirée à l'Opéra. Notwithstanding his obvious lack of musical expertise (or perhaps because of it), Leroux's keen exploration of operatic reception deserves its place alongside more eminent contributors to that tradition such as Balzac, Dumas, and Flaubert. The richness of his portrayal of the institution's mythology and place in contemporary popular consciousness derives partly from his direct use of a large number of sources, which goes far beyond the conventions of the Gothic novel. These range from real and fictional operas to reportage concerning the famous fatal accident at the Opéra in 1896 and the rivalry between Christine Nilsson and Marie Miolan-Carvalho. The most significant of them, though, is the set of gramophone records buried underneath the Opéra in 1907, which was Leroux's inspiration and which emerges as the metaphorical key to interpreting the novel—if not the tradition as a whole.",

    "title": "The Literary and Musical Rhetoric of Apostrophe in Winterreise",
    "abstract": "Abstract In Winterreise, poet Wilhelm Müller frequently used apostrophe, the rhetorical device of “turning aside” to address absent, abstract, or nonhuman listeners. In his songs Schubert responded to the poet's use of this evocative figure of speech. Schubert probably studied a contemporary treatise on rhetoric, the anonymous Institutio ad eloquentiam, and his awareness of direct address and apostrophe are suggested by his use of them in his own writing. Modern literary critics have neglected apostrophe, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Jonathan Culler). Music scholars have explored the persona speaking in a poem and song, but less so who or what is being addressed. Studies of Müller ignore the poet's use of apostrophe. The most extensive discussions of Schubert's Winterreise (Feil, Youens) do not discuss literary or musical apostrophe as such. Fourteen instances of apostrophe occur in eleven of the twenty-four poems of Winterreise. In nine of these, the wanderer turns to address nonhuman objects. In three, the wanderer speaks to himself. In two, the wanderer apostrophizes other people. In four others, Schubert's music approximates rhetorical address. In nearly every instance, Schubert's music changes significantly for the apostrophic address, e.g., in mode, melodic style, register, texture, dynamics. Apostrophe is often characterized as an intensifier, and Schubert's gestures unquestionably add musical weight to the effect of the literary conceit. Schubert's music even implies apostrophic address in some instances where none is explicit in the poetry. It is the rhetorical figure as much as the verse's affective content—the persona's vocative rather than his descriptive mode—that triggers the musical changes. Such response to apostrophe can also be heard in other Schubert's songs. Isolating apostrophe and bringing it to the foreground enriches our discourse about Schubert and the Lied.",

    "title": "Hearts for Sale: The French Romance and the Sexual Traffic of Musical Mimicry",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that veiled practices of gender mimicry facilitated the meteoric commercial success of the French romance in Paris during the July Monarchy. The romance was commonly characterized as a feminine genre particularly suited to women's amateur proclivities. Many critics were quick to emphasize women's putative obsession with romances while downplaying (or altogether neglecting to comment on) the extensive participation of men in the same musical venture. Men composers and poets who sought to pen marketable romances capitalized on aesthetic idioms and values that contemporary writers explicitly appraised as feminine. This article sets out to examine the following: first, critical dialogues surrounding the proliferation of romances during this period of social upheaval; second, the Parisian bourgeoisie's valorization and fetishization of female amateurism; third, the poetics, politics, and economics of gender mimicry in the romance industry; and lastly, the challenges of music criticism and analysis with regard to the ambivalent significations of so-called easy music. Underlying each of these investigations is an attempt to understand the ways in which romanciers and romancières learned to perform femininity in their quests to become professionals in the lucrative business of musical amateurism.",

    "title": "“Ein seltsam Spielen”: Narrative, Performance, and Impossible Voice in Mahler's Das klagende Lied",
    "abstract": "Abstract A quest, a murder, and musical retribution through a dead body part that sings: these are the elements of the folktale known as “The Singing Bone,” a traditional narrative that appears in numerous versions in both oral and literary European traditions. For decades, this tale has drawn the special attention of folklorists because of the remarkable and indeed sensational role played in it by music: its narrative reflects a fascinating ideology of the cultural power of music as the voice of the oppressed, while its musical interludes, chilling spectral songs sung by the bone of the murder victim, invoke the potent and at times unsettling effects of musical performance. Gustav Mahler's first large-scale work, Das klagende Lied, takes up this extraordinary narrative and translates its exceptional features into poetry and musical sound in a manner that especially foregrounds and amplifies the effects of a performing presence in both textual and musical dimensions. Mahler's narrative ballad is a multivoiced text whose temporal and vocal shifts create oscillations between narrative and drama, telling and enactment, giving rise to a remarkable instability of utterance from which repeated evocations of sound and voice emerge. Its musical setting delivers a discourse that similarly exhibits explicit moments of performance, temporal suspension, and sonic dislocation in both voices and orchestra. This extreme volatility of utterance and its resultant effects of presence become the means of the work's embodiment of its own narrative content, such that, in performance, it evokes an experience of the radical sonic rupture that is the story's theme—a theme that reverberates powerfully throughout Mahler's oeuvre.",

    "title": "Passing—and Failing—in Late-Nineteenth-Century Russia; or Why We Should Care about the Cuts in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto",
    "abstract": "The traditional cuts in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto include nearly half of a developmental passage in the first movement and a series of shorter cuts in the finale. The first-movement cut comes after the second tutti, a triumphant thematic culmination that rings false on two levels, since it is a \"polonaise\" in 4/4, and since there has been no first tutti. The developmental passage that follows seems to confirm Tchaikovsky's self-confessed weakness in handling large-scale forms, but may arguably constitute an \"anti-development\" that sets up a mincing violin variation, which, in falling between two versions of the orchestral tutti and rescuing the larger group from its developmental ineptitude, models a homosexuality closeted within the aristocracy (this structural grouping reappears in the original slow movement). The various instances of \"passing\" in this movement (the faux polonaise, the \"second tutti,\" the \"anti-development,\" and a gradually emergent octatonic element in the violin climax just before these events) relate to Tchaikovsky's own \"passing\" dilemma, both as a homosexual and as a Russian nationalist working within Germanic forms; his specific treatment reflects the fact that the concerto was composed between his disastrous marriage and his later affiliation with the imperial court. A particular marker for Tchaikovsky's musical \"passing\" is the blended octatonic passage in the main theme of the finale—which, however, forms the core of the series of traditional cuts in that movement.",

    "title": "Musical Pleasures and Amorous Passions: Stendhal, the Crystallization Process, and Listening to Rossini and Beethoven",
    "abstract": "In De l'Amour (1822) Stendhal elaborated his idea of the \"crystallization\" process in which the distant beloved assumes qualities of ideal beauty in the imagination of the male lover. He also states that \"the habit of listening to music and the state of reverie connected with it prepare one for falling in love\" and, furthermore, that \"perfect music has the same effect on the heart as the presence of the beloved. It gives, in fact, apparently more intense pleasure than anything else on earth.\" These erotic pleasures he identified most consistently and enthusiastically with the music of Rossini. This article takes Stendhal's related notions of love and the sensual immediacy of musical pleasures as models to develop an analytical and hermeneutic approach to musical examples of amour passion. This allows a new reassessment of Rossini's supposed predicament on the \"Other\" side of Dahlhaus's \"unbridgeable rift\" from the music of Beethoven and provides a critique of the relationship between the \"heroic\" male subject with his inspirational beloved. Examples are drawn from Rossini's Tancredi (1813) and William Tell (1829), and Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte (1810), Fidelio, and \"Les Adieux,\" Piano Sonata, op. 81a (1807).",

But midway through its period of creation this conception was discarded in favor of a more original formative model that grew from an intense process of self-reflection. The content of hitherto unpublished letters from his wife written during these months suggests that this transformation was driven by an objectification of Schoenberg's private world.",

    "abstract": "Beyond its glossy surface of virtuosity and lyricism, a violin concerto is replete with a vocabulary of hidden and (on second glance) not so hidden gestures. From Beethoven's timpani strokes to Paganini's marches and fanfares, the genre employs a host of \"heroic\" elements and gestures borrowed from military band music. In the period 1789-1830 these borrowings were hardly restricted to a purely musical level. Rather, I argue, military themes and ideas permeated virtually every aspect of a violin concerto's composition, performance, and reception. In the famous concertos as with countless now-forgotten works (of Viotti, Kreutzer, Rode, Baillot, Spohr, Alday, De Beriot, Lipinski, and Prume), the combination of military topoi with the soloist's leading role characterized the violinist as a military hero. Simultaneously, the tendency to compare violinists to mythological or historical figures became increasingly focused on the image of military leaders (Scipio, Alexander, and Napoleon). All the while, the act of performance exuded masculine codes of power, partly through the symbolism of the bow as a weapon. Taken together, it is these codes of military heroism and gendered power that shaped the culture of violin virtuosity, itself an outgrowth of a larger cultural trend stemming from NapolŽonÕs own military heroism.",

    "title": "Navigating Sonata Space in Mendelssohn's Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt",
    "abstract": "Felix Mendelssohn's establishment of the concert overture as a domain of lively compositional innovation represents one of the most important achievements of orchestral music from the period immediately following Beethoven's death. In their remarkable ability to evoke lofty extramusical subjects through a purely instrumental medium, Mendelssohn's overtures were christened as vessels of musical progress in a manner that anticipated significantly the claims of the midcentury Lisztian symphonic poem. To grasp more fully the overtures' progressivism, though, we must attend closely to the relationship within them between formal particularity and programmatic implication. This endeavor is especially appropriate to Mendelssohn's Meeresstille und gluckliche Fahrt, whose idiosyncratic formal dimension raises pressing hermeneutical questions. Mendelssohn based this work on two poems by Goethe that trace a liberating progression from the deathly immobility of a becalmed sea to the redemptive vitality of a rising wind and the promise of homecoming. While commentators have often noted the overtly pictorial moments of Mendelssohn's overture, only recently has programmatic inquiry turned toward the unfolding of the considerably broad musical voyage itself. But here the analytical privileging of the work's thematic process has supported the image of a journey with little risk. By contrast, a more thoroughly genre-based look at the overture's Gluckliche Fahrt portion reveals a voyage laden with perils as well as possibilities.",

    "title": "Verdi and Sacred Revivalism in Post Unification Italy",
    "abstract": "This essay sets the late sacred works of Giuseppe Verdi in the context of the late-nineteenth-century fascination for the revival, performance, and festive celebration of historical cultural figures and artworks. From the 1870s onward, certain artistic trends became prevalent in post-unification Italy: anxiety to instill a sense of nation into art and everyday life, nostalgia for a vanished golden age of Italian artistic history, and an ever more energetic revival of historical artistic forms and styles. These currents were stimulated by a nationalistic Catholic revivalism that, I argue, was the strongest influence on Verdi's late career. I outline Verdi's reception in and his personal association with the Catholic revivalist movement, developing a view of Verdi's late life and works as articulating shifting trends in the Church and conservatory. As well as revealing the impact of revivalist aesthetics on the style of works such as Verdi's Pater noster, this inquiry suggests that revivalism contributed to a \"canonization\" of his image that intertwined civic and religious history.",

    "title": "Silence, Echo: A Response to \"What the Sorcerer Said\"",
    "abstract": "In \"What the Sorcerer Said,\" Carolyn Abbate proposed a reading of Dukas's Sorcerer's Apprentice (1897) focused on the possibility of musical narration. The present essay shifts that focus to the question of the work's uncanniness and excess. In particular, where Abbate finds that the slow part of the epilogue resonates with her understanding of the work as an instance of narration, I begin with the final two measures of the work, which suddenly revert to the fast tempo of the central scherzo. These final measures, which Abbate does not mention, produce a disturbing regression that suggests another reanimation of the broom. This \"third beginning\" (thus heard in relation to the two preceding moments of animation) marks the broom as an agent of the uncanny (heimlich and unheimlich) in the sense identified by Freud in his essay \"Das Unheimliche\" (1919). Indeed, Dukas's work as a whole is haunted by motives Freud later identified as uncanny: magic, the omnipotence of thought, animism, and involuntary repetition. The essay works backward from the final noise of the piece into a re-reading founded on musical details such as the representation of the brooms through minor- and major-third dyads, the role of the pitch-class Ab, the structure of the central \"reanimation scene,\" and the dismal interplay of motives associated with the broom and the Apprentice. Close attention is given to Dukas's immediate literary source, Goethe's ballad \"Der Zauberlehrling,\" whose use of assonance and repeating rhymes provides subtle structural cues echoed in Dukas's music; I argue that the relationship between the ballad and Dukas's score is more homologous than Abbate was willing to allow. A number of revisions to Abbate's account also emerge through reference to a descriptive note on The Sorcerer's Apprentice left by Dukas in manuscript (Paris B.N.F. Musique MS 1037). Finally, I suggest that this \"symphonic scherzo after Goethe\" conflates literary and musical logics into a peculiar kind of fiction that points to the uncanny nature of narrative itself. Dukas's work ultimately engages the issue of mastery by focusing the listener's attention on the failure of authority and the contingency of animation or de-animation. In this Lacanian \"overflow\" into the unknown, the musical work goes beyond its literary sources, for the broom, not the human figure of the Apprentice, becomes the true protagonist of Dukas's work.",

    "title": "Beethoven Heroine: A Female Allegory of Music and Authorship in Egmont",
    "abstract": "Almost a decade ago, Sanna Pederson observed that the heroic in the posthumous reception of Beet-hoven's life and music functions as a sign of the composer's unassailable masculinity. What Pederson did not explore, however, is how the construction of the heroic in Beethoven's works courts androgyny and so exhibits flexibility in precisely the realm of sex/gender that ossified after his death. In Beethoven's dramatic music, cross-dressed heroines move center stage, and their music courts a mixture of masculine and feminine signs that is not simply descriptive of their transvestism. Admittedly, female heroism in Beethoven's dramatic music is associated with conjugal fidelity (Leonore in Fidelio) and with the nationalist defense of Prussia against French invasion (Leonore Prohaska in Beethoven's incidental music of that name), but it also functioned as an allegory of the semiautonomous male artist and of transcendent authorship. Precisely because women were subject to severe constraints on their public actions, heroines who broke through those constraints were emblems of freedom. At the boundary of the real and the symbolic, women who transgressed sexual and gendered norms could serve as epitomes of transcendence in the aesthetic sphere. A case study of Beethoven's incidental music to Goethe's Egmont traces a metonymic chain linking the lead female character KlŠrchen to music, heroic overcoming, and authorship. Much of the music Beethoven composed for the play was for, or associated with, KlŠrchen, who comes to embody music and its production. Through music, Egmont is lulled to sleep in the concluding dungeon scene. And in this sleep, KlŠrchen appears to him as \"Liberty,\" hovering on a cloud above the stage to a shimmering A-major-seventh chord. Communicating to the dozing hero through wordless musical pictorialism, she offers a glimpse of what in contemporary idealist aesthetics was music's otherworldly source.",

    "title": "Of Serpentina and Stenography: Shapes of Handwriting in Romantic Melody",
    "abstract": "Like nineteenth-century handwriting, Romantic melody consisted of a single unbroken, shaped curviline and was invested with the ability to evoke the ideal, maternal feminine, to evoke deeper images and specific meanings, and to function simultaneously as language and as signifier of infinite meaning. It can be fruitfully compared with stenography, a handwriting-based information technology flourishing in the middle nineteenth century. This article documents the perceived handwriting-like nature of music and the perceived musicality of stenography through writings of E. T. A. Hoffmann, Robert Schumann, Wagner, and the stenographer F. X. Gabelsberger. The perceptual phenomenon of auditory streaming, along with analytical approaches developed by Robert O. Gjerdingen and Eugene Narmour, makes it possible to demonstrate structural similarities between stenography and melody (in examples by Berlioz, Mendelssohn, and Wagner) and to show commonalities between the notion of the \"music of the future\" and the futuristic aspirations of stenography. In turn, it becomes possible to perform the shapes of handwriting in Romantic melody and hear voices and fantastic visions in those shapes.",

    "title": "Hanslick's Idealist Materialism",
    "abstract": "In the mid-nineteenth century, materialist and empiricist modes of thought characteristic of natural science increasingly called into question the speculation of German idealist philosophy. Music historians have commonly associated Eduard Hanslick's Vom Musikalisch-Schšnen (On the Musically Beautiful, 1854) with this tendency toward positivism, interpreting the treatise as an argument for musical formalism. His treatise indeed sought to revise idealist musical aesthetics, but in a far less straightforward way. Hanslick devotes considerable attention to the \"material\" that makes up music and the musical work. The nature of music's materiality is in fact a central pillar of Hanslick's argument, which draws on the abundant literature of the 1840s and 50s promoting scientific materialism and on what might be described as an Aristotelian conception of matter.Hanslick's goal, however, was not to deny idealism, but rather to negotiate a middle ground between idealism and materialism, thereby reconciling a prevailing conception of music's metaphysical status with the physical properties of matter. This is most clearly observed in his carefully crafted conception of the musical \"tone,\" which unites the inner world of thought and the external world of nature. Hanslick's somewhat ironic use of a materialist framework to demonstrate music's inherent ideality betrayed a desire not only to attune musical aesthetics with the latest materialist theories, but also to preserve art music's exclusivity. On the Musically Beautiful is perhaps best understood not as an unequivocal case for formalism but as evidence of the complex ways in which mid-century tensions between idealism and materialism informed German musical discourse.",

    "title": "Evolution versus Authenticity: Johannes Brahms, Robert Franz, and Continuo Practice in the Late Nineteenth Century",
    "abstract": "The early-music revival provoked much heated debate in the second half of the nineteenth century. The leading scholars of the era, Philipp Spitta and Friedrich Chrysander were keen to encourage performances and editions of early music that presented it in the spirit in which it was conceived. This approach met with vociferous opposition from Robert Franz and his supporters, who embraced a Darwinian aesthetic. Although committed to reviving the past, Franz believed that the tastes of nineteenth-century listeners had become too sophisticated to enjoy early music in its original state and modernized it accordingly. The source of the most heated debates was the issue of continuo realization, a topic in which Brahms, through his performing and arranging activities, had a vested interest. Franz, who dismissed the musicologists as artistic philistines, found a difficult adversary in Brahms. Brahms's scholarly inclinations have been well documented, and predictably, his approach to reviving Baroque music reflected a high level of historical awareness. He was, however, first and foremost a creative musician, and as a consequence, aesthetic issues were paramount in his performances and publications. Considerable tensions arose between Franz, and Brahms, and Chrysander, which are explored here in relation to the latter's editions of Handel's Italian duets and trios. The difficulties surrounding continuo practice were not confined to opposition from Franz; even among musicologists there was much disagreement about how the music should be performed. Brahms's approach to continuo realization is considered in this context.",

    "abstract": "Both the literary program of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and his personal letters dating from the year of the work's composition are suffused with the rhetoric of illness, detailing a maladie morale characterized by melancholy, nervous \"exultation,\" black presentiments, and a malignant idee fixe.. Often mistakenly identified as a term new to the 1830s, the idee fixe has a considerably longer history, dating from the first decade of the nineteenth century when it appeared in the writings of French psychiatrists Etienne Esquirol and Jean-Etienne Georget. Both Esquirol's early writings on insanity and his seminal 1838 treatise identify mental \"fixation\" as the primary symptom of monomania, the most contentious and well-known mental disease of the period, and one with far-reaching implications not only for medicine but for Romantic literature, philosophy, and autobiography. Examination of the disease's early reception reveals that, well before Berlioz, the psychiatric terminology surrounding monomania had been absorbed into popular discourse. Malignant and humorous idee fixes appeared in cartoons, diaries, and newspaper articles from the 1810s onward, and in fictional works by Hoffmann, Duras, Scribe, Balzac, and others. Here, and in essays published in musical and literary journals of the period, monomania emerged as an increasingly aestheticized malady, and the idee fixe itself as a signal, not of mental debilitation, but of creative absorption and artistic inspiration. When Berlioz figured himself as a monomaniac, both in his personal writing and his symphonic program, he was responding to a discourse of \"creative aberration\" permeating Romantic literary and medical culture, and to a fashionable fascination with mental pathology. Berlioz was by no means the only artist of the period to diagnose himself with the symptoms of mental fixation. Musset, Janin, and Georges Sand also described themselves in monomaniacal terms in autobiographical \"confessions\" permeated with references to hallucination, fixation, and emotional pathology. Indeed, we can draw clear parallels between the veiled self-referentiality of the Fantastique and the autobiographical strategies of the Romantic Confession. Berlioz's \"self-sounding\" resonates with a host of other confessional autobiographies of the period and reflects the collapse between inspiration and insanity, between anatomy and aesthetics, underpinning early-nineteenth-century theories of genius.",

    "title": "Mendelssohn's \"Scottish\" Tonality?",
    "abstract": "Several of Mendelssohn's minor-mode songs, duets, and choral songs feature a peculiar tonal move: a sudden shift takes us to the relative major (without a \"modulation\" proper), but the opening minor key soon returns equally abruptly (via its V). Closer examination of these pieces suggests that the composer used the major-mode excursus as a topos, whose associations include the ideas of farewell, wandering, and distance (the latter both in the geographical and chronological sense, in accordance with the shift's quasi-modal--thus equally exotic and archaic--character). I suggest that this topos may have influenced the tonal structure of at least three large-scale Mendelssohn compositions, all of which are closely related to the same exotic and historical ideas. In the Hebrides Overture the relationship between the primary B minor and the secondary D major is (for a sonata-form movement) exceptionally equal: rather than acting as sharply contrasting tonal areas, they almost appear as two sides of the same key. The first-act finale of the unfinished opera, Die Lorelei, elaborates the original topos in another way: the E-minor-G-major kernel is extended in both directions, resulting in a chain of third-related keys, which eventually takes us back to the opening E level (now turned into major). In the light of this example, the (less complete) third-layered tonal structure of the \"Scottish\" Symphony may also be understood as growing out from the same miniature song topos.",

    "title": "Occasions and Nations in Brahms's Fest- und Gedenkspruche",
    "abstract": "Brahms's Fest- und Gedenkspruche have long been discussed and sometimes dismissed as an occasional work. But although many scholars have debunked this designation, pointing out that Brahms wrote the motets with no particular occasion in mind, a more salient description of the composition deserves further investigation: the motets are a work for occasions, rather than an occasional work. This article looks at the repercussions of this distinction by focusing on the motets' orientation around the world of plurals (in Benedict Anderson's words) that was both presupposed and fostered by a national culture of festivity in late-nineteenth-century Germany. For one, the title of Brahms's motets--Spruche--references the contemporary collections of sayings that sought to capture and disseminate the multiplicity of the Volk in the new German Kaiserreich. This emphasis on national identity as a localized, participatory act was well suited to the flurry of commemorative festivities taking place throughout the newly unified Germany; it also finds musical expression in the motets. In particular, Brahms makes programmatic use of the double chorus to illustrate processes of unification, narration, and historical continuity, all of which were crucial strategies in the attempt to buttress Germany's new political identity with mnemonic supports. And by setting biblical texts that promote a contractual memory between fathers and sons, Brahms depicts a community in which collective participation in remembering the national past serves as an optimistic bulwark against the centrifugal antagonisms that would soon beset the young German nation.",

    "title": "\"Polemik im Concertsaal\": Mahler, Beethoven, and the Viennese Critics",
    "abstract": "\"Polemic in the Concert Hall\": the title of Richard Heuberger's article in the Neue freie Presse refers in no uncertain terms to the uproar surrounding Mahler's performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Vienna. The two performances, on 18 and 22 February 1900, used Mahler's own orchestral re-touchings of Beethoven's work, and Mahler's biographers have often identified these concerts as the first sustained attacks by the press, attacks that would, over time, only continue to increase in severity and frequency. When these concerts are placed into the context of reactions to Mahler's other Philharmonic concerts, however, this narrative of a \"fall from grace\" proves impossible to sustain. Not only was Mahler denounced for reorchestrating other works from his very first concert with the Vienna Philharmonic, but the language used to do so remained consistent throughout Mahler's tenure. Mahler, as a Jew, was not perceived as having the \"right\" to \"improve\" Beethoven--or any other composer for that matter. Although not overtly anti-Semitic, the language of the reviews resembles that found in Wagner's essay \"Das Judentum in der Musik,\" where he outlines the Jewish composer's supposed handicaps: an emphasis on detail to the detriment of the whole, the prevalence of intellect over feeling, and an understanding of culture as merely \"learnt\" but never \"mother tongue.\" An examination of the critical reactions points out these similarities while also suggesting that, particularly given Wagner's own suggestions (in 1873) for the reorchestration of Beethoven's symphony, the uproar had very little to do with what anyone heard.",

    "title": "\"Rien de la tonalite usuelle\": Edmond de Polignac and the Octatonic Scale in Nineteenth-Century France",
    "abstract": "The reification and theorization of the octatonic scale, arguably one of the principal organizational devices of twentieth-century music, have been long in coming. Rimsky-Korsakov was the first to describe the scale, in an 1867 letter, discussing its use as a Leitmotiv in the symphonic poem Sadko. Stravinsky used the collection as the basis for many of his groundbreaking works, especially The Rite of Spring, but never acknowledged the fundamental role that the \"Rimsky-Korsakov scale\" played in his compositional technique. It took another thirty years for Messiaen to identify the collection as one of the \"modes of limited transposition.\" And another twenty years would pass before Arthur Berger, in a 1963 article, coined the name \"octatonic scale.\"The post-Berger generation of scholars, beginning with van den Toorn and Taruskin, have continued to shed light on the functional and formal uses of the octatonic scale. Taruskin has traced the influence of Schubert's and Liszt's use of harmonic progressions based on mediant and diminished-seventh relations on Rimsky-Korsakov, who in turn influenced a whole generation of early modernist Russians. However, the fact that Rimsky-Korsakov never wrote down in any systematic way the theory underlying the scale that bore his name--in the same way that he codified his theories of orchestration--meant that its presence in early modernist compositions, although used frequently and conspicuously by his followers, remained obscure to those outside his circle. Therefore, the presence of the octatonic collection in the music of non-Russian early modernist composers cannot be easily explained, and the sources of influence are harder to trace.Interestingly, it appears that an important historical link between nineteenth- and twentieth-century octatonic composition--a link with particular implications for the presence of octatonicism in early modernist French music--is found in the music and theoretical writings of Prince Edmond de Polignac (1834--1901), an aristocrat and amateur French composer, who, in 1879, penned not only the first pervasively octatonic composition, but also what appears to be the first treatise on octatonic theory; he went on to write several other compositions based on the \"gammes chromatico-diatoniques.\" In 1894 one of PolignacÕs contemporaries, musicologist Alexandre de Bertha, wrote and lectured extensively about his \"discovery\" of the \"gammes enharmo-niques.\" In this article, I examine the reception of the works and ideas of Polignac and Bertha by contemporary critics and composers, and PolignacÕs role as an important precursor of modern octatonic theory.",

    "title": "August Halm on Body and Spirit in Music",
    "abstract": "This article explores and explains August Halm's and Heinrich Schenker's differing opinions of Brahms and Bruckner based on Halm's notions of corporeality and spirituality, body and soul, in music, and on differences in symphonic style between the two composers. Corporeality manifests itself in thematic gestures whose contours trace distinctive shapes in music's imaginary space, resulting in the impression of depth, something metaphorically tangible. When the dynamic course of a passage is clearly manifest in the aural immediacy of its rhythmic and thematic gestures, Halm acknowledges its corporeality (Korperlichkeit). When a work's dynamic course is concealed or musically too subtle to be readily perceived, it exemplifies a different quality, spirituality (Geistigkeit), which resides in between the notes and occurs, so to speak, subterraneously. Schenker's Urlinie was thus for Halm a case of unnecessarily \"spiritualizing the spiritual yet again.\"Halm's advocacy for Bruckner's symphonies as marking the beginning of \"a new era and culture\" was incomprehensible for Schenker, who conceded to Bruckner only a \"very modest power of invention.\" SchenkerÕs unqualified enthusiasm for Brahms, on the other hand, the \"last master of German composition,\" gave Halm a \"painful jolt.\" For Halm, Bruckner is a \"cosmic epicist,\" for Schenker \"too much a foreground composer.\" Letters between Schenker and Halm as well as other, hitherto unknown archival materials among Halm's estate papers delineate Halm's views in contrast to those of Schenker.",

    "title": "\"Selbst dann bin ich die Welt\": On the Subjective-Musical Basis of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwelt",
    "abstract": "In Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, the title characters conceive their union as a direct linkage between self and world, a linkage that involves a crucial short circuit, bypassing societal conventions and institutions, and echoing the nineteenth-century Germanic disdain for \"Civilization\" as opposed to \"Culture.\" Facilitating this Wagnerian short circuit is a fluid musical discourse that can seem, alternately and even simultaneously, either to simulate a single consciousness, in which impressions and memory freely commingle, or to provide a deep sense of the world, bypassing surfaces to evoke a kind of world-sublime (or \"world-breath,\" as Isolde would have it). Generally absent from Wagner's music are the correlatives of \"Civilization\": well-articulated forms and other markers of conventional musical types, which would disrupt the sense of musical flow essential to WagnerÕs \"Gesamtkunstwelt.\" In this article, I trace the roots of Wagner's practice both in German Idealist thought and in Beethoven, especially as received through a totalizing mode of Beethoven reception fostered by Wagner, in which Beethoven's \"voice\" seems fully coextensive with his music while resonating on a deep level with the Germanic Welt. I then sketch two separately developed modes of post-Wagnerian dramatic music. I first describe how Mahler's novelistic musical discourse sometimes imposes a sense of continuity on the broken surfaces of a world through an overpowering musical \"flow,\" a process that derives from the ways that Leitmotivs emerge from the fluid orchestral fabric of Wagner's music, but reverses the latter's sense of intrinsic embeddedness by beginning with the sounding surface of the experienced world. I then briefly lay out how and why WagnerÕs technique has proven so useful for film music and consider the ways that the overtly Wagnerian scoring of Excalibur (John Boorman, 1981) supports a particularly Wagnerian retelling of the Arthurian legends.",

    "title": "The Third-Act Prelude of WagnerÕs Parsifal: Genesis, Form, and Dramatic Meaning",
    "abstract": "The Prelude to the third act of Parsifal is one of Wagner's most advanced essays in expanded tonality. One author has described it as \"set[ting] foot in atonal territory as it re-explores the melancholy, disjointed polytonal idiom of the introduction to the third act of Tristan,\" and a noted analyst has suggested that it is motion around the diminished-seventh chord including Bb rather than the tonic triad of Bb minor that defines the background structure of the Prelude. This music also raises issues of form and expressive meaning that have yet to be thoroughly addressed.A valuable means of approaching the Prelude is through Wagner's surviving compositional documents, particularly the individual sketches for the Prelude that preceded the writing-out of his first continuous draft for the third act (the Kompositionsskizze [Composition Draft]). These manuscripts are held in the Wagner-Archiv at Bayreuth. When these sketches are transcribed and compared with the detailed record contained in Cosima Wagner's diary entries, insight can be gained into the way that Wagner composed the Prelude, during late October 1878.This article shows in detail how the Prelude was composed on the basis of sketch sources that are virtually complete. It is supported by several facsimiles of Wagner's sketches, transcriptions, analytical graphs, and music examples. The study indicates that the \"melancholy, disjointed polytonal\" idiom of the Prelude is coordinated with a framework of associated tonalities reaching across vast stretches of musical time. These include not only the Bb-minor idiom of Titurel's burial, but also the associated tonality of Parsifal's Prophecy motive. The structural background of the Prelude to act III of Parsifal is not simply a diminished-seventh prolongation, but a tensional framework of motivic combinations and rotational cycles that effectively convey the bleak wandering and promise of deliverance that lie at the core of the drama.",

    "abstract": "Berlioz's final opera, Béatrice et Bénédict (1860–62) has generally been considered a light-hearted work, revelling in the simple joys of love. Yet his final development of the theme of love, which had preoccupied him at least since the Symphonie fantastique (1830), makes this opéra comique more serious than it might appear to be. Drawing on theories of the human subject by Badiou, Žižek, and Lacan, as well as on the resources of Schenkerian theory, this article invites a new attention on the ideological violence done both by conventional models of love (in this case, on the main characters in the opera) and by the language of tonality. Evaluation of the musical means by which Berlioz psychoanalyzes the characters of a masochist, Héro, and a hysteric, Béatrice, ultimately reveals a surprisingly provocative work of vivid psychological drama.",

    "title": "Adapting Debussy: Dislocation and Crisis in Prélude à “L'Après-midi d'un faune”",
    "abstract": "Debussy disapproved of Nijinsky's 1912 choreography for Prélude à “L'Après-midi d'un faune,” perceiving dissonance between his fluid melodies and Nijinsky's angular, two-dimensional poses. Because of the patent differences between the music and choreography, commentary on the work has focused primarily on what makes the ballet and music distinct instead of how the ballet might transform our reading of the music; but the Faune ballet is best identified as an adaptation of Debussy's music in which the music is made to tell Nijinsky's version of Debussy's story. As an adaptation, Nijinsky's ballet creates a context that affords a fresh encounter with Debussy's work in a different medium, resetting our understanding, making new interpretations possible, and thus continuing the music's narrative legacy by varying its appearance. Nijinsky's notation of the dance reflects his novel conception of corporeal movement for the ballet, in which the planes of the body are dislocated from traditional organic formations in order to face constantly outward and to move in grooves along the stage. The dominating imagery of dislocation resonates with the polymetric climax in the B section of Debussy's work, which treats the orchestra like a body in pluralistic motion as it establishes a newly eclectic order of movement. Nijinsky's scenario provides a narrative framework to explain the implications of the polymetric event for the subsequent musical plot. The physicality of Debussy's work, which is also highlighted in Ravel's piano transcription, comes to the foreground of the ballet at a moment of crisis: in Nijinsky's story, the B section contains the only touch between faun and nymph as well as their tragic separation, which leads to the faun's emotional instability. This context renders Debussy's polymetric climax a symbol of both fulfillment and loss that affects the return of A-section material, where the flute theme splits into conflicting expressive characters that mirror the faun's emotional vacillation. Undergirding these dissociated themes is a subtle polymeter, which remains as a symptom of the tragic climax.",

    "title": "The Debussyist Ear: Listening, Representation, and French Musical Modernism",
    "abstract": "Musicologists have long recognized that “sensation” played an important role in the musical culture of debussysme. Close readings of the writings of Debussy and his circle in the first decade of the twentieth century reveal that a key, though often overlooked, aspect of Debussyist sensation is a specifically auditory one—a special mode of attentive listening that claims a privileged knowledge of the natural phenomenon of sound. This account of sensation and listening, which both recapitulates and critiques central components of Helmholtzian sensory physiology, puts Debussy and Debussyism in dialogue with a network of late-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century discourses on the limits of sensory knowledge and resultant problems of representation. Considering Debussyism in this light demonstrates the extent to which musical culture in this period negotiated a modernist crisis of representation salient across high-art culture around the turn of the twentieth century even as it inflected this problem specifically toward issues of sound and listening.",

    "title": "Orientalism and the Lied: Schubert's \"Du liebst mich nicht\"",
    "abstract": "Franz Schubert's \"Du liebst mich nicht\" (D. 756) has often been discussed as an extreme example of chromatic harmony, but one important possible motivator of the song's extravagance--its representation of one of the most exotic of the Orientalizing texts that Schubert set--has largely been overlooked. By considering the song and its interpretation by several recent critics, this essay suggests that the exotic is here represented not by overtly Orientalistic stylistic features, but rather by a pervasive ambiguity, which parallels the features ascribed to the Oriental in a variety of contemporary sources, including a review by Schubert's acquaintance Matthaus von Collin. Unlike such public evaluative texts, however, Schubert's song directly evokes the patterns of emotion and experience associated with the Orient rather than describing and critiquing from a critical distance. A brief consideration of the other songs of op. 59, \"Dass sie hier gewesen\" (D. 775), \"Du bist die Ruh\" (D. 776), and \"Lachen und Weinen\" (D. 777), reveals that \"Du liebst mich nicht\" opens the collection with an extreme representation of otherness from which the remaining songs gradually retreat.",

    "title": "The Body and the Voice in La Muette de Portici",
    "abstract": "This article explores changing attitudes toward actors' bodies at the Paris Opera through the performance history of D. F. E. Auber's opera La Muette de Portici from 1828 to 1879. Because a mime performed the role of Fenella and the chorus played an active role in the mise en scene, the opera placed unusual emphasis on the physical. Over this period, however, emphasis shifted from appreciation of acting to emphasis on singing. For example, during the tenor Adolphe Nourrit's tenure at the Opera critics admired his skill as an actor in the role of Masaniello. When replaced by Gilbert Duprez in 1837, critics praised the tenor's vocal power and lack of emphasis on the histrionic. During this same time, critics began to interpret the gestures of the mime playing Fenella as semantically empty, and her body as filling a space that a singer should occupy. The important role that the barcarolle plays in the opera allows in part for these transitions. Viewed as a chanson napolitaine, it accentuates the rocking of a boat and the physical body at work; however, interpreted as the song of a Venetian gondolier, the song emphasizes the enunciation of a singing voice at the expense of the body. Reviews of La Muette reflect this ambivalence toward performance styles that call attention to the body, particularly those that might be interpreted as belonging to the working classes.",

    "title": "The Boy Brahms",
    "abstract": "During the late twentieth century, the veracity of a particular aspect of Johannes Brahms's boyhood came under challenge. Had he played the piano in Hamburg's dockside bars as many of his biographers had recorded, or had he not? The two sides of the story were debated in the spring 2001 issue of 19th-Century Music. Jan Swafford, Brahms's definitive biographer in English, provided the case for the status quo, citing all the known instances of times when Brahms himself had mentioned the story to friends and biographers. Styra Avins, a translator of many of Brahms's heretofore untranslated letters into English, provided evidence to the contrary by saying all the friends and biographers were mistaken. Swafford's inventory of sources is complete, but there remained more to be said. In \"The Boy Brahms\" I have attempted to show how Avins's evidence is strictly circumstantial and speculative. At this remove from the incidents in question it can be nothing more. I have attempted to refute the conclusions she has drawn from the young Brahms's handwriting, the testimony of neighbors, and the laws governing attendance in the bars, among other things. I have also attempted to show inconsistencies in Avins's arguments that throw into question her thesis and support the veracity of the original story.",

    "abstract": "The Columbian Exposition (the World's Fair in Chicago, 1893) was intended to represent the entire progress of human history, with American civilization as its culminating triumph. The Exposition celebrated the four-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the New World; it restaged that discovery in myriad ways: from the display of \"savage races\" on the Midway to the construction of an emergent American middle class as civilization's newest noble savages, hungry for education. Music was an integral part of the Exposition. America's musical elite took an active role in the fair's promotion and design. The Exposition also stimulated a flood of writing on the nature and future of \"truly American\" music.This article examines American musical culture at the Exposition, with attention to music as art, science, and commerceÑthree categories at the heart of the Exposition's formal definition of music. The network of mutual reinforcements, contradictions and the related concepts of nation, race, and evolution has powerful implications for the ensuing history of music in America. Analysis of the educational agenda of music at the Exposition suggests it taught its visitors--5 to 10 percent of the American population--a great deal about race, class, nationhood, and their identity as consumers. Reading the musical criticism, speculative philosophy, and patriotic grandstanding that accompanied the fair shows how musical thought of the day relied on evolutionary theory.",

    "title": "Seascape in the Mist: Lost in Mendelssohn's Hebrides",
    "abstract": "Mendelssohn's overture The Hebrides or Fingal's Cave is regularly considered the musical landscape (or seascape) painting par excellence. Scarcely another work has such an unerring capacity to suggest the wide horizons, delicate nuances of changing color and light, the ceaseless rolling of the ocean breakers and freedom of the sea. Nevertheless, despite the popularity of this idea of musical landscape since the early nineteenth century, it is far from clear analytically or phenomenologically how the predominantly aural and temporal experience of music might convey a sense of visual space that would appear central to the perception of landscape. This article explores Mendelssohn's archetypal example of the musical seascape in order to unravel these concerns. After briefly charting the philosophical reefs that encircle this issue, I examine how the aural may nevertheless translate to the visual, and thus how music might create its own, virtual landscape. Traveling beyond this, however, we reach the limits of mimesis and the visual for explaining Mendelssohn's overture, uncovering his music's implications for mythic-historical and personal memory, synaesthesia, and the embodied subject. Ultimately I argue for a more ecomusicological understanding of Mendelssohn's work as embodying a critical reading of a fragile human subjectivity within nature, an immersive projection of the wild, northern sublime.",

    "title": "Nationalizing the Kujawiak and Constructions of Nostalgia in Chopin's Mazurkas",
    "abstract": "The traditional musicological perspective on Chopin's slow, minor-key mazurkas and mazurka sections—that he modeled these episodes on the kujawiak, a Polish folk dance from Kujawy region—is plagued by contradictory statements. Re-evaluation of source material reveals that the kujawiak, as it is understood in relation to Chopin's mazurkas, is largely a creation of Polish nationalism after Chopin's time. In Chopin's own time, the term kujawiak is used only sporadically and appears to be interchangeable with mazur; by the end of the nineteenth century, however, the kujawiak becomes an important marker of Polishness for which authors offer specific but widely diverging musical characterizations. It is around this time that writers also begin to emphasize the kujawiak's impact on Chopin's mazurkas, forging a persistent link between this imagined \"national dance\" and his compositions. In place of these vague and conflicting constructs, it is proposed that Chopin used the slow mazurka—the kind widely but anachronistically called the kujawiak—to summon nostalgia for the spatially and temporally distant (and mythical) Poland, through musical styles and gestures that include reminiscence and allusion; auditory distancing; disruptions of form and genre; and surface distortions. Nostalgia as a cultural and medical concept also provides a prism through which his contemporaries perceived Chopin's illness, his experience in exile, and his music.",

    "title": "French Folk Songs and the Invention of History",
    "abstract": "A favorite project of scholars in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century France was to collect folk songs from various French provinces and to add new harmonic accompaniments before publishing them. This folk-song project, like so many others, has obvious nationalist undertones: gathering songs from every French province and celebrating an essential and enduring French spirit. Yet the nuances of this project and its broader context suggest a diverse set of concerns. An examination of the rhetoric around folk-song collection shows how French scholars of the period conflated history and geography: they made the provinces the place of history. Collecting songs from the provinces thus became a way of recovering France's past. Paired with contemporary discussions of musical progress and especially those related to harmony, the addition of piano accompaniments to monophonic songs now reads as a form of history writing. In this article, I argue that French music scholars of the fin de siècle acted out their preferred narratives of music history through folk-song harmonizations. What seemed like a unanimously motivated nationalist project actually reveals the development and contestation of the discipline of music history.",

    "title": "The Ob-Scene of the Total Work of Art: Frank Wedekind, Richard Strauss, and the Spectacle of Dance",
    "abstract": "This article examines the musical, literary, and theatrical practice of a group of early German modernists—above all Richard Strauss and Frank Wedekind. All of them turn to dance, its unmediated physicality, and its erotic charge to articulate a response to Richard Wagner's theatrical project, specifically the concept of the total work of art. Although Wagner had included a few ballet numbers in his mature operas, he treated the form (and the number as such) as a threat to a specifically operatic plenitude of sensuous meaning—dance, he feared, threatened to dance music and drama right off the stage. I argue that this allowed certain post-Wagnerians to interrogate Wagner's aesthetic through the category of obscenity—the dancer who, by dint of her brute physicality, could disturb and misalign theatrical spectacle became an important figure in their art. After a planned collaboration on a number of ballets came to naught, Strauss and Wedekind each turned to their native media to stage and interrogate balletic forms: Strauss through the medium-scrambling Dance of the Seven Veils in Salomé, Wedekind by inserting his ballet drafts into a strange novella, Minehaha, Or on the Bodily Education of Young Girls. Strauss's collaboration with Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which was to prove far more consequential and productive than the one with Wedekind, likewise began with an abortive ballet draft, and again came to reflect on dance's role in other media (opera and theater, in this case). Their reflections on the role of dance in operatic and theatrical spectacle find their expression in Elektra's final dance, which turns on its head the mysterious persuasiveness that Wagner had feared in dance and that Wedekind and Strauss had used to such effect in Salomé: a dance so expressive no one is moved by it.",

    "title": "The Turk in the Mirror: Orientalism in Haydn's String Quartet in D Minor, Op. 76, No. 2 (“Fifths”)",
    "abstract": "Abstract In an article on Orientalism and musical style, Derek B. Scott posits a near-exhaustive list of musical characteristics that act as Orientalist signifiers. Measures 85–88 in the development section of the first movement of Haydn's “Fifths” Quartet contain eight of them: augmented seconds, sliding or sinuous chromaticism, Phrygian mode, repetitive rhythms, a repetitive small-compass melody, arabesque, parallel movement in fifths, and ostinato. It is difficult to imagine that this passage could have contained any more Orientalist signifiers and still have made sense as Western art music at the twilight of the eighteenth century. If Haydn's string quartets are like four civilized persons holding a conversation, then at this point the interlocutors are speaking a foreign tongue, and that foreign tongue could be Ottoman Turkish. For centuries, the Turks had dwelled in the imaginary world of European exoticism as denizens of a mysterious East as close in geography as it was remote in custom. They were typically represented as either sensual, inviting, and voluptuous (their feminine manifestation), or inexplicably menacing or dangerous (the masculine manifestation). This article draws from musicology, cultural and literary theory, and psychoanalysis as well as my own analysis in order to help explain the impact of music that is overtly Orientalist, intended as a foil to the rest of the movement. I present this music as a hermeneutic window opening up to broader issues of meaning, and I discuss the implications of such signification in the construction of Western identity.",

    "title": "Matinee Mania, or the Regendering of Nineteenth-Century Audiences in New York City",
    "abstract": "Abstract New York by 1850 was the leading U.S. city in population, trade, industry, and culture. Its many public musical offerings took place in the evenings, requiring women to have escorts for safety and respectability, and limiting their attendance opportunities. Beginning in 1847 with the New York Philharmonic's opening of daytime rehearsals to women, matinee performances gradually proliferated, extending women's access to opera, concert, and musical theater and transforming audiences from male to mainly female by century's end. The process increased women's access to public spaces for music, changed theaters from male clubs to women-friendly venues, and furthered the education of women as amateur musicians and of those newly empowered to become professionals. Freedom to attend musical events became part of the growing consumer culture, which also brought women out of the home. These profound changes took place in the context of the first American women's movement, 1848–1920. While of far less significance than the vote or control of their own resources, matinees brought women out of domestic confinement to freer access to the public life of the city. That in turn encouraged women to imagine, and some to achieve, public lives.",

Its author, Susan McClary, both reflects on issues of identity politics then and now—including the ways in which ethnicity and gender have operated in her own career—and explores how Grieg himself theorized his fusions between the German school of composition and Norwegian folk music.

    "title": "Rough Music: Tosca and Verismo Reconsidered",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article offers a new interpretation of the operatic phenomenon known as verismo, and of the relationship of Puccini's Tosca with that movement. In contrast to previous scholarship on verismo, which often treats the relationship between literature and music as transparent, I stress that marrying empiricist aesthetics to traditional operatic values was a highly unnatural process. I suggest that Italian opera in the 1890s was pushed to a sort of crisis point, and that the very act of singing could no longer be taken as self-evident. Composers developed a set of new techniques—offstage song, performer-characters, an extreme reliance on bells—to deal with this sudden untenability of operatic convention. All of these techniques were elaborated most fully in Tosca, and the opera might be read as an allegory of the verismo moment, embodying the conflict between hard-nosed realism and unapologetic singing in its two antagonists: Baron Scarpia and Floria Tosca. The plot clearly endorses Tosca's position, but a close reading of the opera's music suggests a rather different interpretation. By focusing on the role of bells in the opera, I argue that realistic sound often overwhelms the autonomy of the characters, at times seeming to collapse them into the scenery itself. Early critics were disturbed by this aspect of the music. Listening to the opera with their ears may help us realize that—despite its overt celebration of individual freedom, and its much-lauded critique of state-sanctioned violence—Tosca exhibits an antisubjective impulse that has much in common with other “Fascist” and “proto-Fascist” texts.",

    "title": "Nineteenth-Century Music? The Case of Rachmaninov",
    "abstract": "Abstract In two of Rachmaninov's last works, the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini of 1934 and the first of the Symphonic Dances of 1940, a stylistic contrast between an opulently scored lyrical theme and the more angular, dissonant music that surrounds that theme throws into relief the extent that Rachmaninov's musical language had changed and developed since his first great successes thirty years earlier with the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Symphony. The words that motivate a similar stylistic contrast in the song Son (Sleep), composed in 1917, near the end of his most compositionally productive years, suggest an interpretive reading of such a stylistic contrast: the earlier, lusher style is associated here with dreams, and hence with memories; while the later, sparer, more tonally ambiguous style accompanies an evocation of something more impersonal, in the case of the song the stillness of a dreamless sleep. Some of the developing aspects of Rachmaninov's style revealed in these later examples are already evident even in the more traditional-sounding pieces of the last decade (1907–17) of his Russian period, which is shown in an analysis of the piano Prelude in G# Minor of 1910. Even this seemingly traditional Prelude, but more and more in his later music, Rachmaninov emerges as an indisputably twentieth-century composer.",

    "title": "Flowers over the Abyss: A Musical Uncanny in Nineteenth-Century Criticism",
    "abstract": "The term unheimlich (uncanny) comes into usage in German music criticism in the nineteenth century and is often used to describe instrumental music, particularly sections of works featuring the ombra topic. While the idea that instrumental music can be uncanny regardless of text or program is not novel, this work differs from most existing scholarship on the musical uncanny in that it presents a possible precursor to the twentieth-century psychoanalytic uncanny. Instead, it examines Schelling's definition of the uncanny in the larger context of his ideas in order to form a basis for theorizing a version of this aesthetic category that is active in the nineteenth-century critical discourse about music. In the early nineteenth century, music becomes uncanny because it discloses what should remain hidden from finite revelation. Critics understand passages of instrumental ombra music as uncanny moments when music calls attention to itself as the sensuous manifestation of the Absolute. They remark on these passages' effacing of boundaries and sense of becoming, residues of eighteenth-century uses of the topic in operatic supernatural scenes and as part of a chaos-to-order narrative in symphonic music. The article concludes with the reception of the opening of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the finale of Schubert's Octet, D. 803, using critics' comments as a basis for extrapolating, through new analyses, as to the features that might make the particular works remarkable as examples of music's uncanny power made manifest.",

    "title": "Writing at the Speed of Sound: Music Stenography and Recording beyond the Phonograph",
    "abstract": "Music shorthand systems devised by Michel Woldemar, Hippolyte Prévost, and August Baumgartner adapted the quill strokes of speech stenography to the seemingly analogous domain of music. Eschewing conventional staff notation in favor of cursive lines that indicated pitch, register, interval, and duration, music stenographers endeavored to record in real time instrumental improvisations and fleeting inspirations that would otherwise have been lost forever due to a lack of recording technology. To advocates of such methods, more efficient technologies of musical writing were indispensable for capturing fugitive musical thoughts and acts: music stenography aided Hector Berlioz, for example, in the composition of his Requiem. For others, including Rossini, Fétis, and contributors to the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, the claims and merits of stenography were a source of controversy as well as fascination. Grounded in a corpus of seventy music stenographies that have been largely ignored by musicologists and historians of technology alike, this article asks how musical intuitions became musical texts, thereby entering print-based networks of circulation. Although the importance of \"genius\" and \"work\" as historical concepts regulating the production, ontology, and reception of nineteenth-century music has long been acknowledged, the material basis of these concepts has been overlooked until recently. The efforts of musical stenographers demonstrate that the inscription and circulation of material texts provided the means by which musical inspiration could be registered and stored, constituting a material substrate on which such idealist concepts depended. Whereas historians of sound recording have focused on seismic historical and cultural shifts wrought by the introduction of the phonograph in 1877, the preoccupation with capturing music in the decades preceding and following this date suggests an alternate conception of text-based sound recording.",

    "title": "\"A History of Man and His Desire\": Ferruccio Busoni and Faust",
    "abstract": "Relying on knowledge of Karl Engel's edition of the Volksschauspiel, Karl Simrock's version of the puppet play, Gotthold Lessing's Faust fragments, and versions of the Faust legend by Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, among others, Ferruccio Busoni crafted his own hybrid libretto that depicts a mystical and broadminded Faust. Busoni's music reflects the richness of Faust's mind, combining heterogeneous timbres, forms, and styles. Busoni juxtaposes a Gregorian Credo, Palestrina-style choral settings, a reformation hymn, a Baroque instrumental dance suite, an organ fantasia, recitatives, a lyrical ballad, and orchestral variations, with impressionistic symphonic writing, and experimental passages. While stylistic heterogeneity can be heard throughout many of his mature instrumental and vocal works, Busoni also used this heterogeneity in a descriptive way in Doktor Faust to characterize Faust. At the same time, Busoni sought to write \"a history of man and his desire\" rather than of a man and the devil. It is Faust's own dark side, rather than the devil, that distracts him and prevents him from completing his greatest work. With Kaspar removed from the plot, Mephistopheles, who as spirit is not always distinct from Faust the man, becomes Faust's alter ego. This duality is expressed musically when Faust assumes Mephistopheles's characteristic intervals. Although Busoni's incomplete Doktor Faust, BV 303, has already been studied by several scholars, including Antony Beaumont, Nancy Chamness, and Susan Fontaine, there is still no detailed analysis of Busoni's treatment of Faust. Through analyses of autobiographical connections, Busoni's early settings of Faustian characters, and the text and music in Doktor Faust, with special attention on the Wittenberg Tavern Scene that has no precedent among the versions of the Faust legend, this article reveals Busoni's vision of Faust as a broadminded, and yet conflicted character, shaped idiosyncratically to convey Busoni's personal artistic ideals. In so doing, the article not only contributes to ongoing discourse about Doktor Faust, but also expands knowledge about ways the Faust legend was interpreted and set musically in the early twentieth century through intertextual comparisons.",

    "title": "The Work of the Orchestra in Haydn's Creation",
    "abstract": "Abstract Crucial to the spectacular effects of Joseph Haydn's Creation (1798) are his precise manipulations of his orchestra. From the brilliant moment of light to the colorful depictions of animals, these moments depended upon the new status of the orchestra in the late eighteenth century. Haydn's ability to control his instrumental forces so diversely reflected the consolidation of the modern orchestra as a concept, institution, and musical body. This article uses the Creation as a starting point to explore dramatic changes to late Enlightenment music and musical discourse from a material perspective of instrumentation. The transformation of the orchestra created the possibility for new styles of orchestration that engaged in precise and nuanced ways with instrumental sonority; no longer was the orchestra a blunt force, but rather an autonomous community of “envoiced” instruments capable of a variety of expressive nuances. Looked at more broadly, this consolidation also allowed for the increased circulation of large orchestral compositions around Europe, which in turn contributed to the idea of the modern musical work. Approaching the music of this period from the perspective of orchestration also invites a reconsideration of Haydn's “Vorstellung des Chaos”: rather than transgressing the boundaries of form, melody, or harmony, Haydn undoes the fabric of the orchestra, creating chaos out of the inchoate gestures of the instruments. His representation of chaos is a process by which disparate instruments coalesce to become a unified ensemble; the creation of light is at once the creation of an orchestra.",

    "title": "Parlor Games: Italian Music and Italian Politics in the Parisian Salon",
    "abstract": "Abstract Among a community of Italian political leaders and artists who settled in Paris after the failed Italian revolutions of 1831 was Count Carlo Pepoli, author of the libretto for Bellini's I puritani. During his years in Paris, Pepoli also wrote the poetry for two song collections: Rossini's Soirées musicales and Mercadante's Soirées italiennes. Both collections are conceived as a series of picturesque images of Italian locales interspersed with pastoral scenes; they are also linked by allusions to a character named Elvira, perhaps a projection of the heroine of I puritani. This article explores the connections between the Rossini and Mercadante songs and their possible link to Bellini's opera, in relation to two distinct audiences: the Parisian salons of the 1830s, with their strong Italian expatriate presence, and the market of amateurs who purchased sheet music. In both contexts, the poetic content and musical style of the songs may have fostered favorable attitudes to Italy and to Unification, showing that even music composed for private and domestic uses could be politically influential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although it has long been accepted that the 1854 version of Brahms's B-Major Piano Trio contains references to Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte and Schubert's Schwanengesang, it has escaped notice until now that the piece also alludes, clearly and in a structurally significant manner, to Domenico Scarlatti's Sonata in C Major, K. 159. Strong musical evidence for this additional allusion is corroborated by Brahms's long-term, multifaceted engagement with Scarlatti's music as demonstrated by his correspondence, music library, performance repertoire theoretical studies, and other compositions. The revisions Brahms made to the Trio in 1889 are also highly suggestive: for the first time, the three theme groups replaced by altogether new material can be understood to correspond precisely to those containing the clearest allusions to the music of other composers. Identification of the Scarlatti reference necessitates reevaluation of the oft-proposed idea that the Trio's song references function as a lament for Brahms's own “distant beloved,” Clara Schumann. The reference to Scarlatti, while potentially supportive of such a program, also suggests an alternative interpretation: perhaps the Trio's allusions are best understood within the context of the young composer's struggle to reconcile his relationship to his predecessors in the heady period surrounding the publication of Schumann's “Neue Bahnen.” If the original Trio represents an elegy for the musical past, rather than—or even in addition to—a lament for Clara, then the 1889 revisions, no longer to be understood simply as Brahms's attempt to expunge an embarrassing confession of love, must be considered in terms of the historical perspective of the mature composer.",

    "title": "The Crystal Palace Concerts: Canon Formation and the English Musical Renaissance",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the role of London's Crystal Palace in the popularization of “classical music” in Victorian Britain, and in the creation of the orchestral canon in the nineteenth century. The Crystal Palace was originally built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was reconstructed in the London suburb of Sydenham in 1854. This popular attraction assumed a musical prominence in British culture when the ambitious conductor Augustus Manns established an orchestra there in 1855, and presented a series of Saturday Concerts until 1900. Central to this discussion of the significance of the Crystal Palace concerts are two audience plebiscites that Manns conducted, in 1880 and 1887, which shed much light on Victorian popular taste and musical values. As well, particular attention is given to his involvement in the “English Musical Renaissance” in both of its aspects: as a campaign to raise British composers to canonic stature (to construct a “British Beethoven”); and as an effort to securely embed classical music within British culture.",

    "title": "Vernacular Song and the Folkloric Imagination at the Fin de Siècle",
    "abstract": "This article foregrounds discrepancies between vernacular singing in England and the work of London's Folk-Song Society during the 1890s. Figures such as Lucy Broadwood, Kate Lee, and Hubert Parry acted as gatekeepers through whom folk culture had to pass in order to be understood as such. Informed by colonialist epistemology, socialist radicalism, and literary Romanticism, what may be termed the \"folkloric imagination\" concealed the very thing it claimed to identify. Folk song, thus produced, represents the popular voice under erasure. Situated as the antidote to degeneration, burgeoning mass consumer culture, and escalating urbanization, the folk proved to be the perfect tabula rasa upon which the historiographical, political, and ethnological fantasies of the fin de siècle could be inscribed. Positioned as a restorative bulwark against the shifting tides of modernity, the talismanic folk and their songs were temporal anachronisms conjured up via the discursive strategies that attempted to describe them. Increased attention should hence be paid to singers such as Henry Burstow and the Copper brothers of Rottingdean in order to rescue their histories from the conceptual apparatus of folk song.",

    "title": "A Reading of Massenet's Esclarmonde by Chabrier: How Should French Composers Respond to Wagnerian Music Drama?",
    "abstract": "At the time of the 1889 world premiere of Massenet's Esclarmonde, Emmanuel Chabrier copiously annotated a copy of the piano-vocal score of this opera, which is considered, despite its unique features, one of the most Wagnerian works of the author. This remarkable and little-known document allows us once again to investigate the challenges of musical creation in a period when all dramatic composers were obliged to position themselves in relation to Wagner, particularly in France where lively debates were taking place between supporters and detractors of the master of Bayreuth. This new source also enriches our knowledge of two composers who, each in his own way, sought to respond to Wagnerian theater, all the while being inspired by it: from Wagner's example both composers drew subjects based on legends, used reminiscence motifs or enriched their orchestral and harmonic palettes with Wagnerian techniques; but Massenet remained faithful to closed vocal forms, which Chabrier rejected in favor of more continuous composition. Chabrier, however, shows himself captivated by Esclarmonde, for Massenet's score attests to the desire, very clear in both composers, to avoid blind submission to Wagner's influence, especially to the point of losing one's own identity.",

    "title": "Sentimentalism, Joseph Joachim, and the English",
    "abstract": "Joseph Joachim's role in nineteenth-century English concert life is long celebrated. As yet unexamined, however, is how his performances and reception informed critical debates on sentimentalism. Joachim was a prominent celebrity in the domestic salons of mid-century, for example the Holland Park Circle, where his performances were described as perfect echoes of beautiful interior designs and his status confirmed by G. F. Watts's famous portrait. This article builds on the relationship between \"sublime sentimentality\" and \"domestic aestheticism\" in the writings of John Ruskin, a prominent member of these salons. It explores how Ruskin's idea of moving from domestic \"sites,\" through \"patterns\" to \"states\" in which the heartfelt is expressed in coded, synecdochal or allusive evocation, even in abstract abstract design, can offer insight into the sentimental dimensions of Joachim's salon performances. Crucially, Ruskin considered both domesticity and sentimentalism as designs and expressions of feeling which are capable of expansion into large forms and contexts, of moving from the intimate to the public. The second part of this article explores sentimentalism in works composed for the concert hall, provoking critical debate at the turn of the century. Tovey's Victorian tastes were strongly influenced by both Joachim and Ruskin, but Tovey's assessments of Joachim as the violinist reached the end of his career exemplify the wide critical turn against mid-century sentimentalism. In 1902 Tovey praised Joachim for making no concession to public sentimentalism, in particular through demonstrating a \"Classical\" grasp of form, by contrast with those who seek sentimental effect through slowing down the performance of \"beautiful\" passages. In a late echo of Ruskin, Tovey desired that one must be susceptible to the beauty of \"design.\" The article ends by comparing Sargent's late portrait of Joachim, presented at the Jubilee celebrations of 1904, with that of Watts.",

    "title": "Grand Opéra—Petit Opéra: Parisian Opera and Ballet from the Restoration to the Second Empire",
    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of grand opéra around 1830 resulted in large-scale works in five acts setting libretti largely based on historical subjects that dominated much European stage music until the First World War. But these shifts in generic paradigm came at a price. The repertoire of the Paris Opéra was based as much on ballet-pantomime as on opera, and until 1830 both genres would share the stage in a single evening. Although the aesthetic impulses behind grand opéra made programming new opera and ballet henceforth impossible, the state required the Opéra to maintain the balance between opera and ballet in order to reserve the institution's “pompe et luxe,” a situation that called forth a number of responses from its management during the period that all Parisian opera houses were controlled by license (1806/7 to 1864). In the short term, the Opéra continued using older smaller-scale works to accompany ballet as part of the same evening's entertainment, but despite the canonic pressures this exerted it was a practice that could not be sustained indefinitely. A second alternative was to shorten up-to-date grand opéra, to bring them down to dimensions at which they could be performed with ballets; the best-known example of this procedure is the reduction of Rossini's Guillaume Tell from four acts (1829) to three (1831). A third possibility was the process of morcellement: the extraction of individual acts or pairs of acts from grand opéra and their performance alongside ballet. A longer-term strategy, and one so far entirely ignored in modern scholarship, was the development of a new type of stage music specifically to accompany ballet: petit opéra. Emerging from two closely related works at the same time as the birth of grand opéra, Rossini's Le Comte Ory (1828) and Auber's Le Philtre (1831), petit opéra was the direct result of institutional pressure from the state for the Opéra to mount productions of both opera and ballet, the preference of the institution and its audiences for evenings with both opera and ballet, and the indirect aesthetic pressure engendered by the appearance of grand opéra. The tradition of composing petit opéra continued up to the end of the licensing period in 1864 and encompassed, among such foreign imports as Weber, Verdi, and Donizetti, works by Halévy, Adam, Thomas, Auber, and Rossini; two of the best-known casualties of the complexities surrounding the genre were Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838) and Wagner's scenario for Le Hollandais volant. Petit opéra was characterized by libretti in two acts with a limited number of musical compositions, a clear distinction between composed number and following recitative (a decisive break with grand opéra), a limited number of characters and a comic register; it developed a set of conventions that remained consistent from its origins ca. 1830 to its latest presentations in Alary's La Voix humaine (1861) and Massé's La Mule de Pedro (1863).",

    "title": "Music of the Future, Music of the Past: Tannhäuser and Alceste at the Paris Opéra",
    "abstract": "Abstract The 1861 productions of Wagner's Tannhäuser and Gluck's Alceste at the Paris Opéra led to a major turning point in reception of both composers in France. After Tannhäuser's spectacular failure in March of that year, the management of the Opéra decided to mount Alceste, a move that critics took as an invitation to compare the two. It was in the preface to Alceste, after all, that Gluck had directly expressed his famous operatic reforms, which Wagner's later aesthetic principles were often perceived to echo or, less charitably, to plagiarize. Critics in the 1850s had begun to make connections between the two composers, but reception of these two 1861 productions cemented a link that would last well into the twentieth century. Despite the considerable amount of scholarly attention devoted to reception of Wagner in France, to date his link to Gluck in contemporary French criticism has not been examined in detail. Yet ideas about Gluck's achievements provided the framework for how critics, and presumably their readers, understood the “music of the future.” A close examination of critical reception of the 1861 productions of Tannhäuser and Alceste sheds new light on perceptions of both Gluck and Wagner in nineteenth-century France and reveals the extent to which their musical identities were intertwined in French music criticism.",

    "title": "Viennese Moderne and Its Spatial Planes, Sounded",
    "abstract": "Abstract The opening of Mahler's “Der Abschied” from Das Lied von der Erde demonstrates a special set of musical conditions that include spare textures, a wide disposition of instrumental forces, and the effect of temporal suspension. This transparency allows the process of individuation and exchange between musical elements to come to the fore, especially in relation to timbre. Through this passage Mahler highlights voices that work in synthesis with those that are juxtaposed. The first half of the study explores how this music is defined spatially through this process. It then proposes that this space is historically meaningful because Mahler's construction of musical space is analogous to the visual tensions in the landscape works of his artistic contemporaries Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. In both musical and visual context, these tensions reflect the diversity of the Viennese Moderne through their ephemeral and laconic qualities. Mahler's compositional tendency to “suspend” time and flatten the sonic plane gave his critics fodder for an ideological argument that involved ornamentation versus organic development, since his methods reflected ambiguously on the nineteenthcentury tradition of teleologically based symphonic forms. “Abschied” derived its relevancy from neither static surface nor motivic development but by its capacity to suggest unique spatial relationships. The movement initiates a timbrally and rhythmically nuanced recitative, in the form of subtle decays and articulated renewals. Like Klimt's superimposed visual planes, which create a synthetic relationship between figure and ground, Mahler's music suggests incremental distances between subjects. The economy of his music relates also to Schiele's laconic subjects. In Mahler's landscapes, both types of experiments coexist.",

    "title": "Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni, Operatic Canon, and National Politics in Nineteenth-Century Prague",
    "abstract": "After the enormous success of Le nozze di Figaro at Prague's Nostitz Theater in 1786 and the world premiere of Don Giovanni there in 1787, Mozart's operas became canonic works in the Bohemian capital, with numerous performances every season throughout the nineteenth century. These nineteenth-century Prague Mozart productions are particularly well documented in the previously overlooked collection of theater posters from the Czech National Museum and the mid-nineteenth-century manuscript scores of Le nozze di Figaro. Much sooner than elsewhere in Europe, Prague's critics, audiences, and opera institutions aimed at historically informed, \"authentic\" productions of these operas. This article shows that the attempts to transform Mozart's operas into autonomous artworks, artworks that would faithfully reflect the unique vision of their creator and not succumb to changing audience tastes, were closely linked to national politics in nineteenth-century Prague. As the city's population became more and more divided into ethnic Czechs and Germans, both groups appropriated Mozart for their own narratives of cultural uniqueness and cultivation. The attempts at historic authenticity originated already in the 1820s, when Czech opera performers and critics wanted to perform Don Giovanni in a form that was as close as possible to that created by Mozart in 1787 but distorted in various German singspiel adaptations. Similar attempts at historical authenticity are also prominent in Bedřich Smetana's approach to Le nozze di Figaro, during his tenure as the music director of the Czech Provisional Theater in the late 1860s. German-speaking performers and critics used claims of historical authenticity in the 1830s and 40s to stress Prague's importance as a prominent center of German culture. During the celebrations of the 1887 Don Giovanni centennial, furthermore, both the Czech and German communities in Prague appropriated Mozart's operas into their intensely nationalistic debates.",

    "abstract": "Franz Schubert's song cycle Die schöne Müllerin makes enormous demands not only on the performers but also on its audience, a factor that shaped the early performance history of the work. In this article, the pioneering complete performances of Die schöne Müllerin by the baritone Julius Stockhausen (1826–1906) will be explored, as well as the responses of his audiences, collaborators, and critics. The circumstances surrounding the first complete performance in Vienna's Musikverein on 4 May 1856, more than three decades after the cycle was composed in 1823, will be traced. A survey of subsequent performances reveal two things: within Stockhausen's concert career at least, it was no foregone conclusion that the complete cycle should always be performed; and a performance of the \"complete cycle\" meant many different things in his day. Stockhausen's artistic idealism jostled against the practical forces that necessarily influenced his approach to recital programming, leading to a multifaceted, untidy performance history for this cycle.",

    "title": "\"Svesti la giubba,\" or, Uncloaking the Genesis of Pagliacci",
    "abstract": "In 1943 Allied bombs destroyed the archives of Leoncavallo's publisher, Sonzogno, and of the Teatro Dal Verme, where Pagliacci was first performed. As a result, many sources pertaining to the opera's compositional history were lost, and scholarship has relied almost exclusively on Leoncavallo's unpublished autobiographical manuscript, \"Appunti.\" Contextual sources such as notifications in the press, eyewitness accounts, and a large body of mostly unpublished correspondence now suggest that Leoncavallo cloaked the opera's genesis to protect its legacy. Leoncavallo was twice charged with having imitated an existing play. In his protracted defense, he took every opportunity to distinguish his libretto from the literary tradition to which it belongs and tie it instead to the verismo movement (with which critics had associated it since the premiere). He began to claim, for instance, that the libretto was based on a crime of passion he had witnessed in Montalto and invented a version of that crime that matched the libretto. Furthermore, in preparation of the first performance in Paris, he actively contributed to a staging faithfully depicting Montalto in an attempt to highlight the originality of the story. And as he was tightening the opera's connection to verismo, he was concealing aspects that would have reflected poorly on the opera's reception, including Sonzogno's initial concerns regarding the music and the presence of substantial musical self-borrowings.",

In this article I explore the critical strategies used to explain away the success of two such works, Wellingtons Sieg and Der glorreiche Augenblick—works marginalized by the “Beethoven Hero” paradigm that came to regulate critical interpretation of the composer's music as well as underwriting the Beethovenian canon. I also explore ways in which such noncanonic works might be reexperienced, reading Wellingtons Sieg in terms of an aesthetic of hyper-representation and Der glorreiche Augenblick in terms of the enactment of community: such approaches, I argue, give access to aspects of Beethoven's music that the “Beethoven Hero” paradigm suppressed.",

    "title": "Dancing the Symphonic: Beethoven-Bochsa's Symphonie Pastorale, 1829",
    "abstract": "Abstract. On 22 June 1829, the legendary French harpist, convicted forger and escaped felon, Robert Nicolas Charles Bochsa performed his most infamous musical offense: a rendition of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony with stage action. Since Grove, this surprisingly early reworking of the Sixth as a ballet-pantomime has not gone down well in the literature. As the twentieth century unfurled, the moment steadily receded into obscurity, losing all cultural and contextual meaning to the point where it is now remembered (if at all) as a lesson in the rogue potential of performance—a pockmark on the historical map. This article will reverse the general slide into amnesia by first excavating this vanished but important moment of the musical past, and then recuperating its seriousness. Enough evidence from the 1820s and 30s suggests that Bochsa's Symphonie (performed at London's King's Theatre) was representative of much more than itself. Far from historically inexplicable, it can be read as an extreme manifestation of a strongly defined ballet-concert exchange that characterized the artistic trends of the late 1820s. By taking on abstract and “musical” forms, dance was becoming more concertlike. Concerts, meanwhile, were developing balletic traits in their increasing use of picturesque effects, and their growing fascination for the visual or bodily aspects of musical performance. A rapprochement took place that reshaped the nature of listening and figured the emerging concept of the musical work in a curiously plastic, objective way—as the case study exemplifies.",

    "title": "A Backdrop for Young Sibelius: The Intellectual Genesis of the Kullervo Symphony",
    "abstract": "Abstract. In April 1892 Jean Sibelius conducted the premiere of his Kullervo Symphony in Helsinki. As the young composer's first symphony and his only choral one and as his first setting of texts from the Finnish epic the Kalevala, Kullervo appeared to be a bolt from the blue. Closer examination, however, shows numerous forces at work, not only in Finland but also across Europe, that formed the essential backdrop to Sibelius's powerful, breakthrough composition. The author explores the literary, artistic, social, and political circumstances that provided the fertile soil from which the explosive Kullervo sprang.",

    "title": "Aesthetic Amputations: Absolute Music and the Deleted Endings of Hanslick's Vom Musikalisch-Schönen",
    "abstract": "Abstract Eduard Hanslick's Vom Musikalisch-Schönen (1854) is the single most important document in the history of the construct known as absolute music, the idea that music functions as an entirely self-contained and self-referential art. Hanslick deleted—and did not replace—the final paragraph of the first edition, cutting most of it for the second edition of 1858 and the remainder for the third edition of 1865. This original ending evokes imagery that stands out from most of the rest of the treatise, including references to the “great motions of the cosmos” and “profound and secret connections to nature.” Scholars have pointed to the apparent inconsistencies of both tone and substance in this paragraph over and against the rest of the treatise to explain its later deletion but have not suggested why Hanslick might have ended his treatise in this way originally. The evocation of “connections to nature” points to the influence of Naturphilosophie, a mode of thought particularly prevalent in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century that posited a basic unity of all nature. Proponents of Naturphilosophie, including such major figures as Schelling, Ritter, Goethe, and Ørsted, believed that the basic forces of nature were all interconnected. Ernst Chladni's demonstrations of the geometric patterns that could be created by sound under certain conditions fascinated his contemporaries and provide an example of how motion, sound, form, and beauty might all be interrelated. Hanslick saw tönend bewegte Formen (“forms set in motion through tones”) as the essence of music, and his original ending suggests that the kind of motion resulting in sound was related to the motions at work in physics, light, magnetism, and other forces, the “great motions of the cosmos.”",

    "title": "The Floral Poetics of Schumann's Blumenstück, Op. 19",
    "abstract": "Abstract Robert Schumann's Blumenstück, op. 19, a short piano piece dating from 1839, is generally not included among the composer's more poetically inspired or formally adventurous pieces. Thanks in part to Schumann's own disparaging remarks about the piece, Blumenstück, like the stylistically similar Arabeske, op. 18, has been viewed as a fairly straightforward effort to appeal to amateur consumers—especially women consumers—of domestic piano music. Rather than recuperate Schumann's piece through a revelation of its structural achievements, this article links the piece's mixed aesthetic status to the similar standing of flowers (and the genre of flower painting to which Schumann's title alludes) in early-nineteenth-century German culture. Emblematic of women and the expression of conventional sentiments, flowers nonetheless constituted a remarkably evocative symbol in Romantic literature. Sentimental and Romantic discourses of the flower converged in the trope of Blumensprache (the language of flowers), an idea that found expression in both popular manuals cataloguing the meanings of flowers and the more esoteric environments of Schumann's criticism, E. T. A. Hoffmann's tales, and Heinrich Heine's poetry. In each of these venues, flowers served as imaginary conduits joining mundane and transcendent realms. Drawing on the work of Friedrich Kittler, I argue that Schumann's Blumenstück, with its conflicting imperatives of pleasure and instruction, congenial melody and motivic intertwining, conflates aesthetic and reception-based categories in a related manner and, as a result, undermines traditional means of generic classification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hairpins, the notation symbols < and >, are today universally accepted as equivalent to the markings crescendo and diminuendo, calling for an increase or decrease in volume. This view is irreconcilable with the scores of the core German repertoire of the nineteenth century. This article offers a new understanding of hairpins based on careful examination of the scores of Brahms and of early-twentieth-century recordings by artists close to him. In Brahms's milieu hairpins did not prescribe sounds, but rather described meanings. The difference between prescription and description is central, suggesting that instead of “growing louder/quieter,” hairpins are better understood as “becoming more/less.” The means by which “more/less” was realized by nineteenth-century musicians included many techniques beyond dynamics, most notably agogic inflection.",

    "title": "Mourning, Remembrance, and Mahler's “Resurrection”",
    "abstract": "Abstract “You must have had the experience of burying someone dear to you,” wrote Gustav Mahler in a letter explaining his Second Symphony to the music critic Max Marschalk, suggesting that the critic's own experiences with death might help him better understand the symphony. Inversely, if listeners bring personal losses to bear on the piece, Mahler's Second Symphony offers one possible model for coping with death. If we take the distinction that Sigmund Freud draws between two responses to loss—melancholia and mourning—as a discursive frame, Mahler's Second Symphony may be heard as an attempt to come to terms with the death of a loved one by moving gradually from melancholia to mourning. According to Freud, a melancholic subject cannot truly cope with the traumatic experience and instead reenacts it, but someone who mourns truly remembers the loss and thus commemorates the dead, allowing them to live on, if only in memory. Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.",

    "title": "From the Mine to the Shrine: The Critical Origins of Musical Depth",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the analytical concept of structural depth has been subjected to intense critical scrutiny. But amid debates over the relative merit of depth- and surface-oriented modes of listening and analysis, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the history of the two terms in music journalism. Focusing on the period around 1800, this article examines the entry of the term \"depth\" into German literature on music and explores the metaphorÕs diverse, even contradictory, meanings. Writers like Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and E. T. A. Hoffmann endorsed the idea, prominent in German Pietism and the criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder, that sound was uniquely able to access the deepest regions of subjectivity. At the same time, such writers began to imagine a musical inner space uncannily similar to the inner space of the listening subject. Unlike earlier aestheticians of a poetic bent, Hoffmann thought that the \"deepest\" works--works that stirred the soul with special force--required the critic to \"penetrate\" their \"inner structure.\" Given that earlier technical discourse had treated music essentially as a linear sequence of periods, HoffmannÕs writings exhibit a momentous shift in perspective from the sequential to the vertical. By adding a new dimension to music complementing its axis of horizontal or temporal unfolding, Hoffmann imported the full spectrum of depthÕs meanings, ranging from the scientific to the spiritual, the rational to the irrational, into the modern notion of the masterwork.",

    "title": "Paganini's Quest: The Twenty-four Capricci per violino solo, Op. 1",
    "abstract": "Nicolo Paganini (1782-1840) has long been viewed as an emblem of virtuosity, his music heard, if at all, through the variations and adaptations of other composers. This historical neglect and the Paganini mythos notwithstanding, the twenty-four Caprices, op. 1, published in 1820, establish his place as a serious composer whose innovations must be considered in any assessment of early Romanticism.In the Caprices, two voices seem to speak. The first is lyrical and draws on the vocal and operatic roots of PaganiniÕs musical upbringing. The second I have labeled the questive voice. Romanticism is an aesthetic of distance; the questive voice is a means of traversing the immensity that is the one essential feature of early Romanticism in its incarnations. This immensity manifests itself in the wide registral space opened and explored in the Caprices; in the motivically driven, asymmetrical construction of many passages found therein; and in the extensive harmonic reach of many of the Caprices. This article presents close readings of Caprices nos. 1, 2, 4, 9, and 10, drawing on Schenkerian methodologies and work by Ratner, Caplin, and Burnham to articulate the lyrical/questive dichotomy and interplay between technique and expression in these singular works by a singular composer.",

    "title": "The Meaning[s] of \"Without\": An Exploration of Liszt's Bagatelle ohne Tonart",
    "abstract": "In this essay, I explore historical and theoretical issues germane to an understanding of an 1885 piano composition with an intriguing title: LisztÕs Bagatelle ohne Tonart--a bagatelle \"without tonality\" or \"without a key.\" After briefly describing the workÕs history and musical associations with other compositions by Liszt, I survey two present-day approaches that reveal ways in which the work defies tonality: octatonic interpretations via set-class examinations, and Schenker-influenced prolongational models. I then turn to focus instead on how the Bagatelle fit within the framework of nineteenth-century musical thought; how its processes were supported by contemporaneously evolving theories of chromaticism. Partly through an analysis based on the practice of Gottfried Weber (1779-1839), I demonstrate that the Bagatelle is not a piece \"without tonality\" as much as it is one \"without the fulfillment of the tonic.\" It maintains harmonic tension by avoiding anticipated resolutions, as well as by preserving a sense of ambiguity as to what the actual \"missing\" key is.Next, I consider why Liszt was prompted to write a piece in such a manner. We know that he was a proponent of musical progress--of Zukunftsmusik (\"music of the future\")--but for this fact to be relevant we must confirm, first, that Liszt had definite ideas about a Zukunftsharmoniesystem; and second, that such a system is reflected in the processes exhibited by the Bagatelle. I argue that the BagatelleÕs traits are indeed in accordance with theoretical views about musicÕs future direction, to which Liszt subscribed. Relevant theories of Karl Friedrich Weitzmann (1808-80) and Fran ois-Joseph FŽtis (1784-1871) are assessed. Lastly, in a \"Schoenbergian epilogue\" I explore connections between LisztÕs operations and SchoenbergÕs ideas, addressing historical associations that conjoin their views of composing \"ohne Tonart.\"I conclude that the 1885 BagatelleÕs attenuation of tonality was part of a tradition that extended from the mid-nineteenth into the early twentieth century--one that stretched from Liszt and his contemporaries through Schoenberg and his pupils and beyond, embracing along the way the theoretical prescriptions of Weitzmann, FŽtis, and Schoenberg himself. The various threads of theory and analysis explored in this article contribute to an understanding of the same strand of musical evolution: the increasing circumvention of tonality to the point that a piece could be written \"ohne Tonart.\"",

    "title": "Silent Narration? Elements of Narrative in Ives's The Unanswered Question",
    "abstract": "In recent years, discussions of narrative in music seem to have fallen into decline. This circumstance might register the effects of the strong stances taken by a few influential writers in the early 1990s regarding the extent to which music can be understood as narrative. This article shifts focus to a different concern, the extent to which music can be related to narrative metaphorically. Using narrative as flexible conceptual framework, it considers Charles IvesÕs The Unanswered Question, a piece whose foundational narrative impulse few would dispute. The central narrative aspects include compositional techniques particular to the twentieth century, such as reordered chronologies and the layering of seemingly independent material. These features suggest comparison with various aspects of narrative structure and narration in literary and filmic narratives. The comparison suggests new ways of conceptualizing IvesÕs music, showing how new techniques intersected with narrative forms, and it suggests that a broader case could and should be made for the continued utility of narratological approaches to music of many different kinds. Particular attention is given to IvesÕs short programmatic note of the early 1930s. The existential program, as expressed through this text and amplified by the music, intersects with the language, imagery, structure, and worldview conveyed in Ralph Waldo EmersonÕs poem The Sphinx and IvesÕs \"Emerson\" essay from Essays before a Sonata. These connections strengthen the notion that both the program and the music were creative reactions to EmersonÕs writings and that some protoversion of the 1930s program existed in Ives mind on composing the 1908 version of the piece. Seeing the presence of Emerson behind IvesÕs original conception of The Unanswered Question helps us to understand the origins of the distinctly narrative aspects of the work and suggests other potential narratives besides the familiar one offered in IvesÕs note.",

    "title": "Dream Analysis: Korngold, Mendelssohn, and Musical Adaptations in Warner Bros.' A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935)",
    "abstract": "Abstract In his first film score, Erich Wolfgang Korngold adapted the works of Felix Mendelssohn so that the music seemed to interact and respond with the visual editing of the film, A Midsummer Night's Dream (Warner Bros., 1935). By detailing the facets of this unusual production, which range from Korngold's presence on the set to the publicity department's efforts to spotlight Mendelssohn's music and Korngold's arrangements, I argue that the score for Dream played an important role in elevating film music and film composers within the hierarchy of Hollywood production and publicity. Not only was the Mendelssohn-Korngold score given greater consideration during the film's making, but also audiences were reminded to listen to the film's music, a facet rarely acknowledged in other contemporaneous publicity drives. Importantly, these changes were effected and rationalized through the self-conscious foregrounding of the music, principles, and rhetoric of nineteenth-century Romanticism. Documents at the Warner Bros. Archive reveal how the confluence of these factors not only established the unusual tenor of Korngold's career within the Hollywood studio system but also helped construct the film composer's public image as an incongruously independent artist working within an otherwise collaborative medium.",

    "title": "Screwball Fantasia: Classical Music in Unfaithfully Yours",
    "abstract": "Abstract Unfaithfully Yours, released in 1948, was the last major film to be written, produced, and directed by Preston Sturges. It ranks high in importance as a late example of “screwball” comedy from the genre's golden age, and as one of the funniest features about classical music ever made. The story centers on Sir Alfred de Carter, an idiosyncratic British conductor (modeled on Sir Thomas Beecham, as played by Rex Harrison), who suddenly becomes suspicious of his wife's infidelity. Jealous to the point of madness, he conducts a concert of three nineteenth-century works: Rossini's Overture to Semiramide (1823), Wagner's Overture to Tannhäuser (1845), and Tchaikovsky's tone poem Francesca da Rimini (1877), and while doing so the film shows us his imagined fantasy scenarios as inspired by the music. Placed within a soundtrack richly filled with voices and effects (often hilariously distorted), the film takes each concert work from objective foreground to ambiguous background status and back again, then deconstructs the three in more cartoonish ways during the final half hour. With reference to studio source materials, to the original significance of each concert work, and to earlier and later films using classical music, the article presents a reading of the film's meanings and shows how it took up the argument about the role of classical music within America's democratic culture.",

    "title": "Recurring Dreams and Moving Images: The Cinematic Appropriation of Schumann's Op. 15, No. 7",
    "abstract": "Abstract Schumann's music took its place alongside that of many other nineteenth-century composers in the lexicon of silent-film accompaniment. Evidence of early-twentieth-century scoring practices indicates that “Träumerei” quickly proved to be an especially popular choice for scenes of pathos and romance. This appropriation is viewed in the context of the piece's general reception history and the tradition of its concert performance in isolation from the rest of op. 15 (and in any number of instrumental arrangements) that had come to a peak at this time. The assumption of “Träumerei” into the world of film is explored with reference to the aesthetics and changing cultural economies of Schumann's own compositional activities, the nineteenth-century Bieder-meier Hausmusik tradition, and the “child” topos. The emergence of a “Träumerei” protocol in film scoring is uncovered in an examination of its continued appearance in animated and live-action sound cinema from the 1930s to the present day. The risks of semantic impoverishment of the music through clichéd film usage are assessed.",

    "title": "Beethoven Overcome: Romantic and Existentialist Utopia in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker",
    "abstract": "Abstract The very last scene of Andrei Tarkovsky's film Stalker (1979) portrays a young girl who moves glasses around on a table just by fixing her eyes on them. As she performs this magical act the “Ode to Joy” from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, alongside the sound of a passing train, briefly appears on the soundtrack. This brief but poignant appearance of Beethoven's music is both arresting and perplexing, but although the scene has received a number of critical readings, it is often noticed without further considerations. The present article concentrates on this overlooked aspect in order to reread the scene and examine the role played by Beethoven's music in it. I argue that Beethoven's music has a symbolic function within the scene and, furthermore, that it can most plausibly be understood as representing the scientific revolutions, the political projects, and the ideological struggles of modern history. I also argue that this symbolic meaning is effectively recoded within the filmic context of the last scene, turning what can be understood as two of the master signifiers of modern civilization's technological, political, and ideological triumphs into powerful representations of the transitory and ultimately meaningless dimension of those triumphs. In the last part of the article I examine a particular phenomenon in the film: the regular return of the compound sound-image consisting of classical music and the sound of running trains. Departing from an interpretive strategy developed by musicologist Lawrence Kramer, I attempt to show that the iteration of this sonic figure amounts to a particular structural trope in the film, namely what Kramer would call an expressive doubling. This eventually leads me to the conclusion that one very rewarding way of looking at Stalker is to see it as expressing or enacting a central tenet of the utopian aesthetics of early Romanticism: the idea of transcendence.",

    "title": "The Operatics of Detachment: Tosca in the James Bond Film Quantum of Solace",
    "abstract": "Abstract I argue that Quantum of Solace, the 2008 James Bond movie, marks a change in the conception of the opera visit in film, which typically shows opera in an idealizing light. Quantum's opera visit, which may be a “first” in an action film, signifies detachment and encapsulates the subjective isolation of the protagonist. The scene's distance comes from the floating operatic venue (Bregenz Festival), the voyeuristic production (“techno-opera”), the frenetic montage in much of the sequence, and the work itself (Tosca), which has parallels with the filmic story. Detachment is further promoted by a dry sound environment, a rearranged temporal scheme, and opera music that approaches underscore in its distance from operatic idioms. Comprised of slow harmonic rhythm and considerable repetition, the two musical excerpts—the Te Deum ending act I and the instrumental music after Scarpia's murder in act II—are noticeably static and impose a groundedness that separates the scene from the film's other set pieces, which are extremely fast in music, sound, and image. The disposition of the operatic music points up the cinematic bent of Puccini's score and its remarkable ability to accommodate the needs of the film. Although Quantum's opera visit is cynical toward opera culture, it captures the postmillennial malaise of the long-running Bond franchise and forms the high point of a film that disappointed critics and fans alike. But while opera may “redeem” the film's larger narrative, the protagonist remains aloof from opera's transforming qualities as he shuns engagement with the spectacle and the resonant music on the soundtrack. Bond's detachment is embodied in the symbol of the set's iconic Big Eye, which not only reverses opera's scopic dynamic by gazing at the audience more than the audience gazes at the stage, but also represents mediated looking at opera in general, as in the Metropolitan Opera's HD cinecasts. While an operatics of detachment may seem like a contradiction, Quantum of Solace persuades us that it can be a vibrant reimagining of the special filmic ritual that is the opera visit.",

    "title": "Listening to the Self: The Shawshank Redemption and the Technology of Music",
    "abstract": "Abstract Music has often been used to symbolize and express ontological experiences. This article explores a mode of nineteenth-century self-audition where music captures a glimpse of the freedom that lies at the core of the subject. This mode of listening has intensified with the development of modern technology and is still prevalent in constructing the identity of the self. The opera scene from the Shawshank Redemption not only is an example of this special effect, but provides a narrative of how music achieves this affect, creating an ideal and virtual self through sound technology.",

    "title": "Schubert: Family Matters",
    "abstract": "Certain anomalous events in the history of Franz Schubert's family raise the possibility that he and his family inhabited a more tumultuous and conflict-ridden domestic universe than has been suspected. Among these are a series of painful losses in his mother's early life, the out-of-wedlock conception of Schubert's eldest brother, Ignaz, and Ignaz's subsequent omission from a schedule of heirs to some family property, along with his extended relegation to the lowly post of assistant teacher for more than a quarter century, until the death of his father, Franz Theodor Schubert, in 1830. In the background of these anomalies is the young Franz Theodor's unexpectedly rapid rise to prosperity in his profession, in which he and his sons had the decisive support of Bishop Josef Spendou, Vienna's superintendent of elementary schools, who was regarded as their \"benefactor.\" Spendou's remarkably extensive devotion to the family's interestsÑincluding supplying a \"scholarship\" for Ignaz and a valued schoolteacher's post for young FerdinandÑopens for inspection several possibilities--that he may have been Ignaz's biological father, and that he and Schubert's parents may have entered into an arrangement whereby he furnished material and professional support to them in exchange for their raising his son as their own. Ultimately, when Franz Theodor died, Ignaz became the sole inheritor of the family's prosperous school, perhaps thereby closing the circle of pledges and obligations that bound Bishop Spendou and the Schuberts together. Left unexamined here are the potential reactions of Schubert and his siblings to their presumed knowledge of these veiled arrangements.",

    "title": "A Voice Unknown: Undercurrents in Mussorgsky's Sunless",
    "abstract": "Mussorgsky's Sunless cycle is aesthetically and stylistically an anomalous member of his oeuvre. Its notably effaced, pared-down, and withdrawn qualities present challenges to critical interpretation. Its uniqueness, however, renders it a crucial work for furnishing the fullest possible picture of Mussorgsky as a creative artist. The author of its texts, Golenishchev-Kutuzov (whose relationship with Mussorgsky at the time of its writing possibly extended beyond the platonic) has been identified by recent scholarship as an essential \"eye-witness\" for those to whom Stasov's populist characterization of the composer does not ring entirely true. Golenishchev-Kutuzov believed that in Sunless Mussorgsky first revealed his authentic artistic self. According to Golenishchev-Kutuvoz, Mussorgsky regarded his signal achievement in Sunless to have been the eradication of all elements other than \"feeling.\" In other words, he had thrown off the stylistic shackles imposed by the aesthetics of realism and relied entirely on intuitive harmonic invention as the sole conveyor of a purely subjective, \"affective\" meaning in the cycle. This hypothesis forms the point of departure for an investigation of select numbers of the cycle. Analysis reveals that the affective aspect is not the only significant element operative. Alongside remnants of the realist style, there is evidence, of varying degrees of subtlety, for a knowing use of symmetrical pitch organization. Mussorgsky not only adapted the usual referential attachments of symmetrically based chromaticism--typically found in Russian operas of the second half of the nineteenth century--he also, through extremely simple but effective means, synthesized the \"intuitive\" harmonic and \"rational\" symmetrical elements of the cycle's pitch organization so that the latter emerges seamlessly out of the former. This remarkable synthesis ensures the cycle's uniformity of tone while also allowing for a reading that extends beyond the generally affective to the symbolically more specific. This symbolic level of reading offers several interpretative possibilities, one of which may refer even to the relationship of the poet and the composer. Irrespective of such potentials for interpretation, the most significant achievement in the cycle remains the synthesis of the intuitive/affective and rational/symbolic elements of its organization. Songs 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the cycle are considered in detail.",

    "abstract": "Beyond Maurice Ravel's 1910 score, the remnants of the original production of Daphnis et Chloe--one known stage photograph, an assortment of studio photographs, seven known costumes, brief reviews, anecdotal memoirs, and a bundle of pastel drawings--constitute choreographer Michel Fokine's 1907 scenario. These materials are scattered across the globe, preserved in libraries and museums in Russia, Sweden, France, England, and the United States. They compose less a ballet, even the archival detritus of a ballet, than a haunting absence. This article assembles all of these materials in an assessment of the differences between Ravel's and Fokine's conceptions of Hellenic antiquity. The discussion focuses on the draft and revised versions of the literary scenario and the draft and revised versions of the finale of the score, cast in 3/4 and 5/4 meter respectively. The ending of the article offers brief remarks on the music-dance relationship in the original and two subsequent productions of the ballet.",

    "title": "“The Expressive Organ within Us”: Ether, Ethereality, and Early Romantic Ideas about Music and the Nerves",
    "abstract": "Abstract A variety of harmoniums populate Honoré de Balzac's novels, including the physharmonica, the orgue expressif, the panharmonicon, and the accordion. The sounds of these instruments typically illustrate unusual mental states. Balzac's musical fantasies drew on contemporaneous medical practice, which between 1820 and 1850 used the harmonium regularly to help treat nervous disorders. The linking of the harmonium with nervous effects resembles earlier associations of the glass harmonica with pathology. However, the medical implementation of the harmonium differs from this tradition both in the instrument's generally positive connotations and in the later trajectory of its use. Studying the discourse of ethereal mediums helps explain why certain types of sounds were thought to have privileged access to the nerves. The unusual timbres and swelling dynamics of newly popular musical instruments, including the glass harmonica, the Aeolian harp, and the Jew's harp, were conflated with ideas about a vibratory nervous system and an ethereal world spirit. Both ideas were essential to the formation of the culturally determined ideal of ethereality in the eighteenth century. Closely linked to contemporaneous ideas about physiology and nervous transmission, the sounds and their presumed access to the nervous system continued to influence the design and reception of instruments, most notably the harmonium, during much of the nineteenth century.",

    "title": "Harmony of Hearts: Marital Love in Beethoven's Leonore of 1806",
    "abstract": "Abstract After the failure of Beethoven's opera Fidelio, oder die eheliche Liebe in 1805, a series of reviews criticized the dramatic layout of the opera and Beethoven's musical setting. Much of the critical response to the first version focuses on an incongruity between the opera's first two acts and its final act. This incongruity manifested itself above all in the suddenness with which the bourgeois marital fantasies of the character of Marzelline gave way to the marital ideals of Leonore in the final act. The duet “O namenlose Freude!” was singled out along these lines for failing to achieve an appropriate musical characterization. Beethoven revised the opera for a production in early 1806 that was much more successful. The revisions he made in the 1806 version are almost always understood as rushed solutions to the most serious problems posed by the original version of the opera. Yet the fact that many of the more elaborate revisions survived until the final version of 1814 suggests that Beethoven and his collaborators did not simply act in haste. As the opera's climactic expression of marital love, “O namenlose Freude!” offers a particularly revealing window on how his ideas about marriage motivated the revision process. In this article I propose a new reading of the 1806 Leonore based on the critical reception of the opera's first performances of 1805 and an examination of ideas about marital love at the turn of the nineteenth century.",

    "title": "Vitalistic Discourses of Violin Pedagogy in the Early Twentieth Century",
    "abstract": "Abstract The pedagogical treatise is generally understood to be a manual of singing or instrumental techniques that is largely practical in approach, yet a critique of violin tutor books dating from the early twentieth century, especially those written by the renowned violinists Joseph Joachim (writing in conjunction with Andreas Moser), Leopold Auer, and Carl Flesch, reveals an extensive engagement with a range of wider ideologies. In a bid to trump the supposedly deadening effects of both a historicism resulting from the availability of earlier treatises, as well as the overly scientific approach taken by contemporaneous treatises, these violinist-authors embrace metaphysical ideals of mind or vitality, and the result is a model of violin playing founded on the concept of “singing tone,” an idea developed out of nineteenth-century notions of song/melody as embodying a vital essence. As did Wagner, in his 1869 essay Über das Dirigiren, writers play with the idea that theoretical and performative categories, such as tempo, phrasing, dynamics, vibrato, and types of bow stroke, both conflict with each other and find a deeper unity in a subjectivist ideal of tone. The approach of these texts is not explorative, however, so much as a rather defensive championing of the idea of mind or vitality: ideologies of self, health, and nationalism ultimately prevail over an engagement with historical evidence in Moser's discussion of ornaments, and Auer's intolerance of any mitigating influence that might qualify the artist's final word on aesthetic matters is reminiscent of a reductive, Nietzschean ideal of vitality. Nevertheless, writers struggle to reconcile it with the messier realities of performing, as an embodied and collaborative activity, and subsequently what speaks louder in their texts are anxieties over affronts to notions of self, expressed using pathological notions common to the era. Whereas at times writers encourage students of the violin to share in their lauding of vitalistic ideals, more often than not they try to impose disciplinary measures as a means of inculcating them.",

    "title": "Adina par excellence: Eugenia Tadolini and the Performing Tradition of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore in Vienna",
    "abstract": "Abstract Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore was subjected to a series of substantial modifications after its premiere in 1832. In this article I focus on the performing tradition of the opera in Vienna. The history of these performances and their reception allow us to examine the dynamics through which the revisions to the score became a standard local practice and to assess historiographical assumptions about the role of Italian opera in nineteenth-century Viennese musical life. The shape Elisir took in the city was the result of interactions between the first interpreter of the leading female role in Vienna, soprano Eugenia Tadolini, impresarios, local music publishers, spectators, and critics. Surviving evidence shows that Tadolini's performative choices became normative in Vienna. Vocal embellishments that she added to Adina's second-act aria, published soon after the opera's premiere in Vienna, survive in performing materials still used at the beginning of the twentieth century. She also substituted the second-act finale of the opera with a virtuosic waltz by Luigi Ricci. This second modification was a telling instance of Tadolini's attention to the reaction of the Viennese to Donizetti's work. By claiming the right to close the opera with an aria of her choice, Tadolini got rid of an unappreciated piece and reinforced the local reception of Elisir as an opera centered on the prima donna. As the development of a Viennese performing tradition of the opera extended beyond the Italian seasons at the Kärtnterthortheater, involving individuals and communities of spectators of diverse national origins, the work functioned as a catalyst for the merging of musical experiences from different parts of the Austrian Empire. As Donizetti himself decided to conceive his own waltzing cabaletta for Tadolini in 1842, I ultimately suggest that this case study recalibrates our understanding of the relationship between authorial intentions and local performing traditions.",

    "title": "Congruence between Poetry and Music in Schumann's Dichterliebe",
    "abstract": "Abstract Poetry and music have in common various ways of structuring sound. In both, one can speak of rhythm, meter, loudness (e.g., accent), and pitch. Beyond sound in the narrow sense, one can also speak of syntax in that both language and Western tonal music create expectations that are satisfied or not in a variety of ways. These material aspects of poetry and music can be the basis for exploring how poetry and music fit together in vocal music in general and in individual works. The study of poetry in these terms came to prominence in the work of Roman Jakobson and others beginning in 1960 and has more recently been taken up by Marjorie Perloff and colleagues. The study of music with words has in general not considered the materiality that they share, especially not in the analysis of individual works. Writers on music have generally placed emphasis on expression of the semantic content of texts instead, privileging texts that can be read in relation to Romantic lyric theory. This has led to the search for word painting of one kind or another that has shaped the understanding of whole periods in the history of music and that is very much with us still, though this semantic domain cannot ultimately be separated from the material aspect of language. This article analyzes Songs 1, 2, 4, and 6 of Schumann's Dichterliebe in terms of this materiality with a view to showing how closely congruent poetry and music can be in their own terms in individual works without dwelling first on what they might be thought to express. This is to speak not at first about meaning but rather about the means by which meaning is created. Analysis of this kind in no way precludes hermeneutics. It is but one starting point and one that bears directly on the act of listening and perhaps performance.",

    "title": "Adorno, Schubert, and Mimesis",
    "abstract": "Abstract In Aesthetic Theory Adorno refers to Schubert as “the mimic par excellence.” The connection between Adorno's conception of mimesis and his notion of Schubert has remained unexplored. In his essays “Schubert” and “Franz Schubert: Grand Rondo in A Major for Piano Four-Hands, op. 107” Adorno developed concepts and drew conclusions about Schubert's formal procedures that had a formative influence on his later understanding of mimesis. Adorno's mimesis is supposed to be a creative synthesis of two dichotomies: the life and death instincts (Freud) and the instincts of self-preservation and letting go (Caillois). In Dialectic of Enlightenment Adorno equates mimesis to the death instinct and development to the life instinct, but only to disguise his departure from both dichotomies. He links every notion of progress to “domination” and reduces it to the mimesis of the “nonorganic,” that which is dead. But Adorno did not purge his mimetic theory of every residue of Freud's and Caillois's dualism. Instead, he constructed a new opposition within mimesis itself: mimicking that which is dead and that which is living. The roots of this change can be found in his essays on Schubert. Mimicking that which is dead may be understood as an elaboration of the idea of “the landscape of death” in Schubert's music, embodied in a “crystalline form” through which the wanderer moves aimlessly. Mimicking that which is living would resemble Schubert's landscapes in which nature is “reconciled and blissful,” landscapes that open up the prospect of regeneration. Schubert's music embodied the irrational hope of all those whom Adorno perceived as mimics—from Schubert to all freedom-loving “wanderers” through the world at the end of history—that one day the hour of regeneration would come and life once more defeat death.",

    "title": "Britten the Anthologist",
    "abstract": "Abstract Benjamin Britten was one of several twentieth-century British composers active before the Second World War who wrote “anthology cycles”—that is, cyclic vocal works on poetry anthologies of the composer's own making. This apparently British invention is deeply indebted to the widespread success of the anthology as a literary form in classrooms, homes, and marketplaces of Victorian and Edwardian England. Britten's early attraction to canonical anthologies such as Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of English Verse (1900), for example, is representative of a cultural practice of reading. Britten and other British composers renewed their connection to that practice when they became anthologists for their musical works, identifying themselves as arbiters of poetic and musical taste. Britten's anthology cycle Serenade for tenor, horn, and strings (1943) uses Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book for as many as four of its six texts, many of which share pastoral themes. And yet the composer's musical settings often seem to challenge a conventional reading of the chosen texts and the generic titles Britten assigned to each movement. By creating a canonical, pastoral anthology and then challenging it through music, Britten, who had just returned to England from the United States, invested Serenade with the potential to present the world of prewar England as embattled.",

    "title": "Chopin's Aliases",
    "abstract": "The ambiguity of Chopin's music and its amenability to reinvention help account for its enduring appeal to pianists, composers, and critics. This article examines the conditions under which such ambiguity has taken shape on the page and at the piano. Just as curves become jagged—or \"aliased\"—when represented by the grid of discrete pixels that form digital displays, so have the contours of Chopin's music been both veiled and disclosed by the straight lines that define the staff and the keyboard. Despite the term's contemporary ring, the issues raised and reflected by aliasing are rooted in a set of nineteenth-century dichotomies concerning the discrete and the continuous, artifice and nature, instruments and bodies, virtuosity and poetry, machines and voices, and constraints and liberties, all of which Chopin's music was heard both to invoke and to elude. By way of recordings and transcriptions by Leopold Godowsky, Marc-André Hamelin, Josef Lhévinne, Vladimir de Pachmann, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and Arthur Rubinstein, the article presents various instances of aliasing and attempts to mitigate it via a range of compositional, pianistic, and cultural techniques that reveal how aliases can produce ambiguity by calling the very distinction between identity and difference into question.",

    "title": "Chopin Fragments: Narrative Voice in the First Ballade",
    "abstract": "This article considers the problem of narration in a collection of works gathered around Chopin's Ballade in G Minor, op. 23: Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, Poe's \"The Raven,\" Mickiewicz's Konrad Wallenrod, Dickens's The Chimes, and Władysław Szpilman's The Pianist along with its cinematic adaptation by Roman Polanski. Chopin's Ballade is featured prominently in the two movies under consideration, while the remaining works are either influential for the composer (Konrad Wallenrod) or develop themes common to the Ballade. Study of narration in these works reveals that the narrator can be just as unstable in literary texts as in musical ones. The problems of narration that have been imputed to music are problems of narration itself. Regarding the era of Chopin's Ballade, these problems also point to unstable models of subjectivity, which the logic of narrative glosses over.",

    "title": "Not a \"Telephone to the Beyond\": Nietzsche's Early Writings on Music",
    "abstract": "Much has been written about the importance of music and music making to Nietzsche's life and works as a whole, and the relevance of his philosophy for particular composers, repertoires, and works. Meanwhile, music historians and philosophers have approached Nietzsche's musical aesthetics by way of larger nineteenth-century paradigms such as \"absolute\" music or the history of \"metaphysics.\" This article explores Nietzsche's philosophical writings on music from the 1870s as they reveal the emergence of his critical outlook on Romantic aesthetics and the musical culture of his time. Against the backdrop of more recent debates about material culture and aesthetics in current musicology, it traces the development of his critical ideas about musical expression and listening as presented in his published and unpublished texts, concentrating on the period from Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geist der Musik (The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music, 1872) to the first volume of Menschliches, Allzumenschliches (Human, All Too Human, 1878). Rather than foreground Nietzsche's relationship with particular composers or works, it illuminates his double relationship with music as actual compositional practice in society and as an idealist metaphor for philosophy.",

    "title": "The Accompanied Sonata and the Domestic Novel in Britain at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century",
    "abstract": "Abstract In their recent research, literary historians have discovered new information about the popular success of British women novelists at the turn of the nineteenth century. Contrary to a canonical rendition of history, which argues that, Jane Austen aside, male writers dominated this period in British history, this new scholarship reveals that there were several women novelists of the late-Georgian era who were among the most widely read authors of their time. Many of these novelists chose the domestic realm as the setting for their stories. In particular, numerous female writers authored novels about courtship. Their works posed a new feminine archetype, which Anne Mellor has called the “new woman,” who valued intellect, self-confidence, and reason, bringing those qualities into marriage. This article locates the “new woman” in music making of the early nineteenth century. Using recent work in the field of English literary history as a paradigm through which to approach music, it notes how accompanied sonatas of the late Georgian era, like novels, posed an alternative to the patriarchal norms of British culture. This study focuses on the work of two British women, the author Maria Edgeworth and the composer Maria Hester Park, juxtaposing two of their works that are stylistically representative of their respective genres: Edgeworth's Belinda, a novel of courtship, and Park's op. 13, no. 2, an accompanied sonata, both of which were published in 1801. These two works—and their genres—articulated a new feminine ideal for a new century; the widespread popularity of the genres helped to integrate this ideal into the very fabric of British society.",

    "title": "Dance and the Female Singer in Second Empire Opera",
    "abstract": "Abstract A vogue for coloratura dance arias began in the 1850s. This emerging genre combined melismatic singing with two hugely popular social dance genres: the bolero and the waltz. Scholars have observed an association between these social dances and a certain euphoric feminine sensuality, but the connection between this youthful ebullience in dance and virtuosic female vocality has been largely ignored. Dancing was notorious in the nineteenth century because of its dangerously arousing and vertiginous effects. As dances increased in speed and difficulty, so too did the singing of sopranos in midcentury Paris. In exploring relationships between dance, femininity, and singing, this article situates coloratura dance arias in the Paris of Napoléon III's Second Empire, a city sometimes condemned for its decadent materialism or dismissed because of its political impotence, in spite of its cultural, architectural, and technological importance. I argue for a connection between coloratura and the female body in precisely the era when the venerable singing style became the almost exclusive domain of the female singer and, simultaneously, reached its apogee in a Paris devoted to all the joy and glamour it could afford. Specific performers such as Marie Cabel and Caroline Carvalho were key to the success and even creation of these dance arias. These sopranos were certainly objectified in a problematic manner, but they were also “envoiced” (Carolyn Abbate's term) as wielders of a compelling musical power: coloratura. In providing virtuosic and luxurious expressions of femininity, these coloratura dance arias established a new sense of female vocality in the aural imagination of the Second Empire.",

    "title": "Melodrama, Two Ways",
    "abstract": "Abstract The word “melodrama” has accumulated a vast range of uses and definitions. It is the name given to the technique of combining words and music (as in the nineteenth-century musical genre); it is also used to name a mode of expressivity that is exaggerated, excessive, sentimental. These definitions appear unrelated, yet the melodramatic mode also seems to emerge frequently in musical contexts, such as opera and film—raising the question of whether the joining of words and music as such already tends toward, or attracts, a melodramatic impulse. This article first sketches the features of the melodramatic mode as they are described in writing on theater, film, and the novel before turning to a close reading of Richard Strauss's Enoch Arden, op. 38, a melodrama for speaker and piano. I aim to show that not only the themes of Enoch Arden's narrative but also the form of its narration, the meaningfulness it draws from the facts or conditions of narration as such, provide its claim to the melodramatic mode.",

    "title": "The Language of an Unknown Country: Intratextuality in Proust's In Search of Lost Time",
    "abstract": "Abstract One of the pivotal scenes of Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time takes place during a performance of the fictional composer Vinteuil's Septet in Mme Verdurin's salon. The narrator and protagonist of the novel, Marcel, finds himself caught off-guard by the beauty of Vinteuil's Septet; he hears in the Septet a calling to the true life of an artist and vows to begin work on his own masterpiece. As he listens to the Septet, Marcel struggles with the concept of artistic individuality. He tries to discern the similarities and differences between the phrases of Vinteuil's Septet and the same composer's Violin Sonata. Marcel comes to the conclusion that it is not superficial or intellectual similarities between two works by the same composer that really count, but rather some underlying substance that can only be “felt as the result of a direct impression.” The aesthetic philosophy embodied in these thoughts is not only applicable to Marcel's appreciation of the Septet. It also provides a lens through which we can come to terms with Proust's twenty-page-long description of the Septet, and it allows us to situate this passage meaningfully within In Search of Lost Time. The Septet scene is one of the most deeply intratextual passages of the novel. But just as Marcel gives pride of place to the “profound similarities” between Vinteuil's compositions over musicologists' “analogies ingeniously discovered by reasoning,” so too can the reader distinguish between more superficial connections between the Septet and earlier scenes, and subtler references that bind the novel together on a deeper level.",

    "title": "“Mon triste voyage”: Sentimentality and Autobiography in Gottschalk's The Dying Poet",
    "abstract": "Abstract The terms “sentimentalism” and “sensibility” play a central role in contemporary scholarly discourse on literature and intellectual theory in the long nineteenth century. Often used interchangeably, these words identify developments in popular culture and philosophy in which emotions and feelings, as opposed to reason and logic, were seen as the routes to moral and social improvement. In visual, literary, and musical artworks of the era, the emphasis on feeling was frequently connected to a male archetype of the sentimental protagonist, a “dying poet,” marked by several common elements: great creativity, high levels of sensitivity, physical and emotional fragility, significant moments of disappointment, and early (and often self-inflicted) death. The subject of the dead or dying young man assumed critical significance during the 1860s, when so many soldiers were lost during the Civil War. For his immensely popular work The Dying Poet (1864), composer-pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk likely drew inspiration from two French poems of the same title that employed both the dying poet trope and complex imagery of reminiscence. Although The Dying Poet was one of Gottschalk's most popular and lucrative pieces, it was composed during a time of relative discontent and melancholy. In the mid-1860s, he was traveling across the Civil War-torn United States on a gruelingly unrelenting schedule. Gottschalk's composition The Dying Poet can be viewed as a poignant paradox—a simultaneous example of his great sensitivity to the desires of his audience and a tantalizingly autobiographical glimpse of the profound loneliness he felt while performing for them.",

    "title": "Narrative Ballet as Multimedial Art: John Neumeier's The Seagull",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article approaches narrative ballet as a theatrical art created through the intersection of dance, music, and literature. Following the nineteenth century's tendency to separate ‘the Arts,’ scholars, journalists, and often the dancers themselves portray ballet as an art of choreography and virtuoso bodies, while relegating the music, story, and visual designs to supportive if not negligible roles. My article counteracts this trend by approaching ballet as a multimedial art, in which meaning is made at the points where the specific arts intersect. Audience members perceive the ballet as a composite work, in which all three elements are equally present and important. Using this model, musicologists and literary critics can and should engage contemporary narrative ballets as complex and relevant art of our time. John Neumeier's The Seagull (2002) demands this type of analysis, because it is clear that as the author of the choreography, costumes, lighting, and set design, Neumeier considers all media involved—visual, aural, and literary—as equally generative elements of a ballet. His role is more of a multimedia artist than a choreographer. He is also responsible for the adaptation from Chekhov's eponymous play and for application of musical selections borrowed from Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Shostakovich, and Evelyn Glennie. Indeed, his choice to present a Chekhov play known for its subtle weaving of verbal dialogue to convey character, mood, and themes seems to force the audience member and critic to reconsider her traditional understanding of what ballet can and cannot do. As an example of a multimodal approach to ballet, this article presents five literary and musical devices expanded to describe the varied interplay of the visual, aural, and literary components in The Seagull. Bakhtin's idea of heteroglossia appears on the ballet stage in the assignment of distinct dance styles to each of the four protagonists, a technique that develops each character by imbuing them with the historical and social connotations of their movement style. Neumeier manipulates the irrefutable connection between music and dance through audiovisual irony in two scenes, where the dance conveys one message, but the music belies it, revealing the underlying ironic truth of the characters' situations. All three modalities are employed to shift time into and out of a reflective space, where the sincerest characters are shown to explore their emotional and artistic dilemmas. Like Chekhov, Neumeier employs echo characters—secondary figures who mirror the conflicts of the main protagonists, allow the author(s) to further develop the play's themes. In this ballet, Masha “echoes” Nina's unrequited love, her movements, music, color palette, and her choices by negation. Through overt application of seagull imagery, Neumeier draws dance and music history—namely, Swan Lake and the pathos of the dying swan—into his ballet, The Seagull.",

    "title": "Idea and Actualization: Bruno Maderna's Adaptation of Friedrich Hölderlin's Hyperion",
    "abstract": "Abstract Among characterizations of the Darmstadt Summer Courses, none is more pervasive than the assertion that Darmstadt represented an intense Modernism, in particular a form of Modernism diametrically opposed to the excesses of Romanticism. But if Darmstadt is to be understood as a response to Romanticism, what are we to make of the ascendancy of Friedrich Hölderlin, a key figure in German Romanticism, as a source for texts? Hölderlin's texts have been a perennial favorite for Darmstadt composers since its inception, but Bruno Maderna undertook the most ambitious use of Hölderlin's works during the period from 1960 to 1969. Maderna's Hyperion, a collection of works based on Hölderlin's writings, amounted to no less than a rethinking of the Modernist project—one that does not shrink from its roots in Romanticism. Like the epistolary novel on which it is based, its idea is only approached through an interchangeable series of fragments, thereby engaging Romantic ideals of the work. Maderna's Hyperion continually awaits its completion through performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD series has sparked interdisciplinary interest in understanding opera in twenty-first-century contexts. This article posits that the Live in HD series creates an intermedial experience for its viewers, one that forms new relationships between operatic performance and audiences through the ongoing intersections of production elements (story, text, music, mise-en-scène, performers) and media-specific concerns (spectatorial gaze, hypermediacy, immediacy, reproducibility, liveness). A reading of act I from the 2009 Metropolitan Opera simulcast of Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann engages the shifting relations regarding the human and the technological as presented to the Live in HD viewer from the vantage point of on, back, beside, in front of, and yet completely discrete from the Lincoln Center stage. The mediated and mediatized relationships engendered by this constant resituating of the audience create a sense of the familiar rendered strange, of being somehow out of place in one's relation to the stage. Media and performance theory are employed in concert with Freud's influential work on the uncanny to describe this as the “intermedial uncanny”: an important aspect of this emergent audience experience.",

    "title": "Medieval Romance and Wagner's Musical Narrative in the Ring",
    "abstract": "Abstract Wagner's engagement with medieval sources like the Nibelungenlied has generally been examined in relation to poetic style in his librettos. One of the defining structural features of his literary inspirations is the narrative interlace structure, which is common to literature, art, and even manuscript organization in the Middle Ages. In place of the classical Aristotelian unity of time, place, and action, the interlace design sets up a literary form based on sudden disjunctions, mysterious failures of explanation, and multiplicities of motive. These formal models propose radically different views of reality and the self: one suggests that human experience is shaped by a culmination that can already be known, the other more contingent, fractured, and paradoxically “modern.” Wagner's incorporation of the interlace design operates in the libretto and, more significantly and complexly, in the music. Wagner's structural and philosophical engagement with his medieval sources in the Ring may be elucidated via a combination of neo-Riemannian and modified Schenkerian analytical approaches and a sensitivity to Wagner's tendency to highlight the structural joints between his massive interlaced threads (rather than smoothly modulating, as the prevalent view suggests). The work is seen to have an existentialist, not an essentialist, view of human nature that provided an intellectual model for the artists and thinkers that grew up in Wagner's considerable intellectual shadow.",

    "title": "Mendelssohn in Nineteenth-Century American Hymnody",
    "abstract": "Abstract The nineteenth century witnessed the rapid rise and gentle decline of an unprecedented vogue, particularly in the English-speaking world, for crafting hymn tunes from the work of Europe's most revered composers. Indeed, through the widely circulated publications of Lowell Mason and several like-minded American editors, it was in the form of hymnody that the European classical tradition reached a substantial part of the American population for the first time.After setting forth broadly the historical underpinnings of such adaptations' dissemination, this study seeks to bring an unprecedented critical focus to the examination of a much-maligned repertoire through an exploration of the hymn tunes based on the work of one of its leading beneficiaries, Felix Mendelssohn. Gathered here are fifty-eight hymn tunes drawn from Mendelssohn's work, capturing what appears (based on a survey of 250 tune books and hymnals) to be the entry point of each particular melody into the American hymn repertoire. This body of music permits us not only to explore a multiplicity of approaches to the adaptation process itself, but to articulate a set of fundamental shifts that appear to have occurred in the genre as the nineteenth century wore on. From the late 1850s onward, we see not only a markedly heightened eagerness to adhere, in the adaptation process, to Mendelssohn's compositional will, but a pronounced move in the selection of melodic material away from the adventurous, catch-as-catch-can breadth of the mid-century publications toward tunes drawn from a more tightly circumscribed body of works that were coming to enjoy an established place in the concert repertoire at large.",

    "title": "Dancing to the Devil's Tune: Liszt's Mephisto Waltz and the Encounter with Virtuosity",
    "abstract": "Abstract Despite its popularity with pianists, Liszt's first Mephisto Waltz (pub. 1862) has been largely glossed over in musicological studies. In this article, I reconsider the relationship between the piano piece and the excerpt from Lenau's Faust (pub. 1836) that inspired it, and I explore potential programmatic interpretations of the rhetorical features and idiosyncratic structure of the music, informed by knowledge of Liszt's aesthetic stance around this period. This hermeneutic approach is framed in terms of certain important sociocultural concerns of the time, including the widespread fascination with the virtuoso as a daemonic agent. The poetic excerpt tells of a crowd being roused to frenzy by the playing of a diabolical instrumentalist, a process that the piece both depicts and (in the act of performance) reenacts. This also links back to Liszt's mercurial career as a performer, during which period such scenes were commonplace. Written long after he had ceased his tours as a virtuoso to concentrate on composition, the Waltz may use Liszt's own remembered experiences, but more importantly it is part of the legacy whereby he hoped to ensure his own lasting place in the cultural memory.",

    "title": "Music, Drama, and Sprechgesang: About Richard Wagner's Creative Process",
    "abstract": "Abstract Wagner's music, aesthetics, and personality were influenced profoundly by the declamation and recitation techniques of his time. “Declamation” as an optic-acoustic phenomenon embraces in this context both the actor's artificial speech and physical delivery. The theatrical declamation of Wagner's childhood and youth, i.e., the declamation of Saxon actors in Dresden and Leipzig during the 1820s and 1830s, differed widely from today's practice. The wide range of pitch, tempo, and dynamics, as well as the highly idealized expression of nineteenth-century German actors, may be described as manifest musical qualities. These qualities have been lost during the course of history, but are preserved by Wagner in his music. As his sketches, letters, and theoretical explanations show, his way of creating a drama may be interpreted as a chain of different performative processes, which employed declamation, recitation, and acting. The final goal of this process was not to create a score or any other scriptural document, but to provide posterity with a fixed tradition of the staging of his works that would remain unchangeable. Wagner's hybrid ambitions in this context become comprehensible when we consider his way of creating a drama. To put it simply: the vocal lines—especially those exhibiting Sprechgesang—resemble the actor's speech very closely, while the orchestral part often has the function of determining the rhythm and expression of the gestures, attitudes, and actions on stage. That theatrical declamation was Wagner's point of departure when he created his works and became forgotten some decades after his death due to profound changes in theatrical performance practice.",

    "title": "Improvisational Idyll: Joachim's “Presence” and Brahms's Violin Concerto, op. 77",
    "abstract": "Abstract Boris Schwarz once characterized Brahms's Violin Concerto, op. 77, as an “intangible interplay between the art of Brahms and that of Joachim.” The celebrated violinist was not only the inspiration for this concerto; he also played a crucial role in its compositional genesis and early performance history. But while Joachim's compositional contributions to the concerto have been well documented, his importance as a performer is usually acknowledged only in vague terms. We sense that Joachim the performer is somehow “in” this concerto without being able to articulate how. This article examines the intersections between Joachim's style and persona as a performer, the cultural meanings ascribed to performance, and specific formal and expressive features of the Violin Concerto. Particularly important was Joachim's perceived ability to present composed musical works as though they were being improvised, created on the spot through a mysterious fusion of Joachim himself with the mind and spirit of the composer. In the later nineteenth century, as the practice of improvisation began to disappear from the concert stage, improvisation could represent a lost ideal of spontaneous, unmediated subjective expression. An analysis of the concerto's first movement shows that it thematizes tensions between two contrasting visions of creativity—one involving spontaneous inspiration and improvisation at an instrument, the other, the rigors of logical, planned out, and written composition. These expressive features take on additional meanings when considered in the context of Joachim's performances of the concerto, and they allow for a recovery of some of its historical meanings that resided not only in the notated score, but also in performed events.",

    "title": "Strauss and Hofmannsthal's Arabella and the Resacralization of the Operatic Tradition",
    "abstract": "Abstract The obvious debt that Strauss's operas owe to Wagner often led early critics to view their conspicuous lack of spiritual depth as an unintentional failure. Recent commentators such as Charles Youmans, Leon Botstein, and Michael Walter have rightly characterized this feature as a conscious Nietzschean strategy calculated to avoid or ironize metaphysical tropes. Following the critique of the concept of “secularization” by Jürgen Habermas and Charles Taylor, however, I wish to complicate this newer interpretation by arguing that Strauss's operas do not represent the point in music history when German music threw off its pretentions to Kunstreligion, but mark yet another point of “re-sacralization”—a term I borrow from Simon Critchley's Faith of the Faithless (2012). The Wagner-indebted music in Arabella (1933)—an opera given much less critical attention than it deserves—certainly never gestures toward any transcendent truth beyond the physical confines of what is presented. Nevertheless, I argue, a sacred economy still operates in the opera whereby certain aspects of the immanent stage-world are figured as “sacred” and others as “profane.” It is possible to trace the influence of the operas Tannhäuser and Parsifal on Arabella, specifically in the harmonic, rhythmic, and timbral techniques Wagner used to mark certain suprahuman forces as possessing a transcendent aura. The music of Arabella uses moderated versions of these techniques to redistribute the same sacred status onto different aspects of material and psychological reality.",

    "title": "Everyday Extraordinary: Music in the Letters of a German Amateur, 1803–08",
    "abstract": "Abstract The 178 letters, nearly all of them by the Halle University medical student and amateur violinist Adolph Müller, published in 1874 as Briefe von der Universität in die Heimath, provide an opportunity to explore in detail one individual's uses of music as a means of social interaction, identity construction, and aesthetic cultivation and reflection during the first decade of the nineteenth century. The immediacy and self-representational nature of the medium of the letter result in a record that makes clear not only the variety of musical experiences at all levels woven into the daily life of a young German Bürger but also how his accounts of those experiences could help align Müller with—and sometimes vividly over against—his family. Participating in and describing music in society as well as extraordinary works (especially Mozart's and Beethoven's) that he came to value explicitly over conventional and socially acceptable music, Müller provides a colorful if often inconsistent account of living with and coming to terms with that music in a daily context of aesthetic values, class and gender ideologies (the latter particularly evident in his musical encounters with Friedrich Schleiermacher), and the institutions and relationships that structured his life.",

    "title": "“Serious Play,” Performance, and the Lied: The Stägemann Schöne Müllerin Revisited",
    "abstract": "Abstract In her 1997 study Schubert, Müller, and Die schöne Müllerin, Youens describes the collaborative Liederspiel (song play) that served as Wilhelm Müller's model for his poetic cycle Die schöne Müllerin and Schubert's more familiar work. This study removes Schubert and his masterwork from the picture to reconsider the Liederspiel as a sociable, performative event and address persistent questions concerning the self, its expression and development, and communicative relationships between selves as mediated through singing lyric poetry. Building upon Youens's suggestion that the event constituted “serious play,” the article considers the implications of such play for understanding the event and for performance-focused analyses of the Lied generally. “Serious play” thus operates in multiple registers, referring to the playful activity of the salon participants themselves; the discourses of “Idealist play” and of “role play”; and importantly to the necessarily “playful” approach that I take to the mobile types of evidence at hand. The first section examines the culture within the Stägemann salon in relation to Berlin salon life before and immediately after the Napoleonic Wars, with special attention to the role of gender and related cultural expectations within the salons. The second section considers Schleiermacher's theory of free sociability as inspired by Romantic salon culture and the broader question of free play as viewed through (historical) idealist and more current critical lenses. After a brief description of the events, poetry, and music of the Liederspiel, the following sections analyze how Wilhelm Müller and Luise Hensel negotiated their way through Idealist play and role play in a salon colored by the growing limitations of Biedermeier culture and particularly the gender roles attending it. By thus viewing the Liederspiel events as multifaceted “serious play,” it becomes possible to advance a new approach to the sung performance of lyric poetry that builds upon but extends the more work-centered text-music approach to the Lied that has dominated the past several decades of research on the genre.",

    "title": "Echoes of the Guillotine: Berlioz and the French Fantastic",
    "abstract": "Abstract The fantastic, theorized as an expression of the anxieties, fears, and political beliefs of the generation of young French writers born in the decades directly following the Revolution and Terror, has long been viewed primarily as a literary genre. Observed in light of this artistic movement, Berlioz's most famous work, Symphonie fantastique, emerges as a musical manifestation of fantastic techniques, and Berlioz himself as an important contributor to the Fantastic culture that swept nineteenth-century France. Using Tzvetan Todorov's narrative theory, I identify two techniques fantastic authors exploit that are most useful in understanding Symphonie Fantastique: an intentional ambiguity of form, and a privileging of ambiguous “thresholds” over teleological plot resolution. In pursuing a new explanation of the symphony's strange deviations from musical norms, I highlight the many different ways the symphony has been understood and analyzed by prominent musicologists over the past 180 years. By now, musicologists have effectively demonstrated that Berlioz was not the “incompetent genius” (in Charles Rosen's wry formulation) he was long considered to be; however, the fact that there is still disagreement and debate over Symphonie Fantastique's deviations from normative form and content, as well as what those deviations might mean, demonstrates the highly fraught signifying structure of the music. Locating the symphony's use of fantastic tropes and techniques demonstrates that many of its strangest aspects—those “failures” that have been the subject of musicological debate since 1835—come into focus when we take its title seriously and regard the work as a symphony in the fantastic genre.",

    "title": "Time and the Keyboard Fugue",
    "abstract": "Abstract Throughout the history of Western music, musicians have almost invariably discussed the keyboard fugue and other extreme forms of polyphony as signs of something that transcends human subjectivity. Despite the persistence of this critical topos, musicians shifted their approach to it around the beginning of the nineteenth century. The shift involved both a change in the technique of counterpoint and a change in the way counterpoint was interpreted. Composers sought to invest the fugue with a new dramatic and teleological thrust suitable to modern times, and critically minded musicians changed their interpretive method so as to emphasize the passage of time. Whereas musicians of the early eighteenth century read counterpoint and the fugue allegorically and annulled time through the conceptual precision of the allegorical image, musicians of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries read the fugue symbolically and worked time into their interpretive process. In both eras, the practice of interpretation coincided with and affected the reading of the genre's temporality.",

    "title": "Smetana's “Vyšehrad” and Mythologies of Czechness in Scholarship",
    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have long framed similarities between Bedřich Smetana's “Vyšehrad” (the first movement of Má vlast) and Zdeněk Fibich's symphonic poem Záboj, Slavoj, and Luděk as a threat to Smetana's originality. In his biography of the composer, for example, Brian Large moved to “exonerate” Smetana from charges of “plagiarism” by arguing that Smetana began “Vyšehrad” at least two years before Záboj's premiere in 1874; not six months later as Smetana's diary attests. Rather than regarding these works' similarities as a problem, this discussion embraces their close relationships as a starting point. Situating both symphonic poems and their reception within the discourses generated by a powerful organization called the “Umělecká beseda” (“Artistic Society,” or UB, in which both Smetana and Fibich participated) illuminates the larger intellectual and aesthetic space from which they emerged. Such a process of contextualization reveals how both composers' works constructed each other and uncovers Smetana not as a “lone genius”—a composer untainted by influence—but as a participant in a shared conversation. Ultimately, this examination opens up new understandings of Smetana and his “Vyšehrad” and invites scholars to reengage with the deliberate subjectivity of Czechness and historiography more broadly.",

    "title": "A Voice of the Crowd: Futurism and the Politics of Noise",
    "abstract": "Abstract In his 1913 manifesto “L'arte dei rumori” (The Art of Noises), Futurist painter Luigi Russolo exhorted readers to “walk across a great modern metropolis with ears more attentive than eyes.” For Russolo, attentive listening to the urban environment enacted a visionary aurality: the city was a mine for “new” noises, such as rumbling motors and jolting trams. However, Russolo's embrace of noise—much like that of Futurist painter Umberto Boccioni and Futurist poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti—was undeniably a product of its time and place. This article excavates the sounds of 1913 Milan as a crucial location for the noises of early Italian Futurism. Not only was this city the Futurists' base, but it also inflected their representations of noise both through its symbolic architectural sites (above all the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele) and the buzz of its human multitudes. In this latter respect, late-nineteenth-century positivist crowd psychology can provide an illuminating context because it shares with Futurism the notion of modern, urban crowd united by a collective unconscious—one that could, moreover, be heard by the attentive listener on a city's streets. This article tracks this historical mode of listening from Russolo's manifesto until the reception of his first concert for an entire orchestra of newly wrought noise intoners—his “Gran concerto per intonarumori,” held at Milan's Teatro Dal Verme in 1914—and explores what was, in this case, a slippery (but critical) distinction between “audience” and “crowd.” Russolo's clamorously received premiere forced its listeners and performers to attend to off- (rather than on-) stage noises, thus raising still-vital questions about where to locate Futurism's noise, influence, and politics.",

    "title": "Ravel and Robert-Houdin, Magicians",
    "abstract": "Abstract When Claude Debussy called Ravel an “enchanting fakir” in 1907, he anticipated a critical approach typified by Vladimir Jankélévitch's 1939 Ravel biography. In it, Jankélévitch evoked the rich language of theatrical magic, comparing Ravel to a sorcerer, conjurer, and illusionist. Contemporary critics used similar terms to describe the composer's music as early as 1909, around the same time that a parallel narrative emerged: Ravel as a master of mechanism and artifice. A contextual study of theatrical magic, which has yet to be applied to Ravel criticism, provides a substantive connection between these narratives of mechanism, enchantment, and artifice. I begin with the French illusionist Robert-Houdin (1805–71), whose enduring legacy furnishes a forgotten background for Ravel criticism. Robert-Houdin claimed that he was not a mere juggler but “an actor playing the part of a magician,” which resonates with accounts of Ravel's Baudelairean artifice in life and work. For magicians, “illusion” was interchangeable with “effect.” The word “effect” recurs in both Ravel's writings and “The Philosophy of Composition,” a theoretical-didactic essay by Edgar Allan Poe, whom Ravel cited as one of his most important artistic influences. Ravel's appreciation of Poe has a much richer grain than has been imagined, extending beyond compositional artisanship to include literary and theatrical stratagems. Robert-Houdin, who started his career as a clockmaker, featured automata at his Soiréé fantastiques—but sometimes, like von Kempelen's Turk, these automata were illusions themselves. Ravel's fascinations with enchantment and mechanism converge in the presence of these trick machines. In the opera L'Enfant et les sortilèges (1925), Ravel uses techniques known to both magicians and cognitive neuroscientists, exploiting the aural equivalent of an afterimage and manipulating the spectator's attentional frames.",

    "title": "RETIREMENT THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT: What Social Work Needs to Know",
    "abstract": "A qualitative analysis of interviews with 33 men and women whose retirement was induced by unemployment examines the economic effects of such involuntary retirement. In the convenience sample, all respondents reported that unemployment led to a drop in retirement income. Those most severely hit by unemployment found the transition extremely stressful, reporting high levels of anger, depression, and sadness and constant worry about their straitened circumstances. People coped with this drop in income by changing their lifestyles, giving up valued assets like their homes, and dipping into savings and RRSPs. These strategies, in turn, depleted their resources for retirement and caused considerable consternation about what they saw as an uncontrollable and unforeseeable future. People also relied heavily on social assistance and disability benefits to survive until the age at which they were eligible to draw upon their retirement benefits. Une analyse qualitative d'entrevues menées auprès de 33 hommes et femmes que le chômage a obligés à prendre leur retraite examine les effets économiques d'une telle retraite involontaire. Tous les répondants ont déclaré que le chômage avait diminué leur revenu de retraite. Les plus durement frappés par le chômage ont trouvé la transition extrêmement stressante, disant éprouver des niveaux élevés de colère, de dépression et de tristesse et s'inquiéter constamment de leur situation difficile. Les gens ont composé avec cette baisse de revenu en changeant leurs modes de vie, en se départissant d'avoirs précieux tels que leur maison et en puisant dans leurs économies et leurs REER. Ces stratégies, en retour, ont épuisé les ressources pour la retraite et les ont profondément troublés face à ce qu'ils considéraient comme un avenir incontrôlable et imprévisible. Les gens comptaient également beaucoup sur les prestations d'aide sociale et d'invalidité pour survivre jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient atteint l'âge d'admissibilité à des prestations de retraite.",

    "title": "Challenges in Enforcing Home Smoking Rules in a Low-Income Population: Implications for Measurement and Intervention Design",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Smoke-free homes reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, contribute to lower levels of consumption, and help smokers to quit. Even when home smoking rules are established however, they may not be consistently enforced. Methods: This study uses data from a randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention to create smoke-free homes among callers to the United Way of Greater Atlanta 2-1-1. Participants with partial or full home smoking bans at 6-month follow-up were asked about enforcement challenges, rooms where smoking occurred, and exceptions to the rules. Air nicotine monitors were placed in a subset of homes. Results: Participants (n = 286) were mostly female (84.6%) and African American (84.9%). Most were smokers (79.0%) and reported at least half of their friends and relatives smoked (63.3%). Among those with a full ban, 4.3% reported their rules were broken very often whereas 52.6% stated they were never broken. Bad weather and parties were the most common exceptions to rules. Among nonsmokers with full bans, 16% reported exposure to secondhand smoke in the home 1–3 days in the past week. In multivariate analyses, having a partial ban, being a nonsmoker, and living with three or more smokers predicted higher levels of enforcement challenges. Conclusions: Findings suggest the majority of households with newly adopted smoke-free rules had no or rare enforcement challenges, but about one-fifth reported their rules were broken sometimes or very often. Interventions to create smoke-free homes should address enforcement challenges as newly adopted rules may be fragile in some households. Implications: Interventions that promote smoke-free homes should address enforcement challenges.",

    "title": "A Role for the DRD4 Exon III VNTR in Modifying the Association Between Nicotine Dependence and Neuroticism",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Neurotic psychopathology has been extensively examined as a risk factor for nicotine dependence (ND). Genetic stratification may partially explain variability in risk estimates. Genetic variants that compromise dopaminergic neurotransmission may motivate exposure to dopamine-stimulating agents, including nicotine. The 7-repeat allele of a Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in DRD4 (and evolutionary derivatives 5, 6, and 8 repeats; 7R+) is associated with reduced dopamine receptor function. The purpose of this study was to examine association between both smoking initiation (SI) and progression to ND by young adulthood and (a) history of neuroticism during adolescence, (b) DRD4 7R+, and (c) interaction between neuroticism and DRD4 7R+. Methods: Participants were drawn from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of the health and well-being of young Australians across 8 waves (14–24 years). Neuroticism was measured at Waves 3 and 6 (mean 15.9 and 17.4 years). SI was defined as any smoking at any wave. ND was measured at Wave 8 (mean 24.1 years). Genotype data for the DRD4 VNTR were available for 839 participants. Results: While adolescent neuroticism was associated with SI, evidence for association with progression to ND was weak. However, there was evidence of interaction between neuroticism and DRD4 7R+: The odds of progression to ND among those with a history of neuroticism were more than 3.5-fold higher among 7R+ carriers. Conclusions: Without considering stratification by 7R+, the association between progression to ND and neuroticism would have been assumed barely significant. However, among those carrying DRD4 7R+, risk of progression was considerably intensified.",

    "title": "The Democratic Political Economy of Progressive Income Taxation",
    "abstract": "Why do both left and right political parties typically propose progressive income taxation schemes in political competition? Analysis of this problem has been hindered by the two-dimensionality of the issue space. To give parties a choice over a domain that contains both progressive and regressive income tax policies requires an issue space that is at least two-dimensional. Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of the standard two-party game, whose players have complete preferences over a two-dimensional policy space, generically fails to exist. I introduce a new equilibrium concept for political games, based on the fact of factional conflict within parties. Each party is supposed to consist of reformists, militants, and opportunists: each faction has a complete preference order on policy space, but together they can only agree on a partial order. Nash equilibria of the two-party game, where the policy space consists of all quadratic income tax functions, and each party is represented by its partial order, exist, and it is shown that, in such equilibria, both parties propose progressive income taxation.",

If workers do not have detailed information about the preferences of other workers and firms, the scope of potentially profitable strategic behavior is considerably reduced, although not entirely eliminated. Specifically, we demonstrate that stating preferences that reverse the true preference order of two acceptable firms is not beneficial in a low information environment, but submitting a truncation of the true preferences may be. This gives some insight into the successful operation of these market mechanisms.",

The sense in which the departure from common knowledge is small is as follows: (i) With probability one, the players know T with precision ±KK.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of the design and sale of a security backed by specified assets. Given access to higher-return investments, the issuer has an incentive to raise capital by securitizing part of these assets. At the time the security is issued, the issuer's or underwriter's private information regarding the payoff of the security may cause illiquidity, in the form of a downward-sloping demand curve for the security. The severity of this illiquidity depends upon the sensitivity of the value of the issued security to the issuer's private information. Thus, the security-design problem involves a tradeoff between the retention cost of holding cash flows not included in the security design, and the liquidity cost of including the cash flows and making the security design more sensitive to the issuer's private information. We characterize the optimal security design in several cases. We also demonstrate circumstances under which standard debt is optimal and show that the riskiness of the debt is increasing in the issuer's retention costs for assets.",

Symmetry says that if two agents have the same preference, they must be treated equally. Anonymity says that when the preferences of two agents are switched, their consumption bundles are also switched. Individual rationality says that a social choice function never assigns an allocation which makes some agent worse off than he would be by consuming no public good and paying nothing. In Theorem 1, we characterize the class of strategy-proof, budget-balancing, and symmetric social choice functions, assuming convexity of the cost function of the public good. In Theorem 2, we characterize the class of strategy-proof, budget-balancing, and anonymous social choice functions. In Theorem 3, we characterize the class of strategy-proof, budget-balancing, symmetric, and individually rational social choice functions.",

However, because employment rates in the United Kingdom are often low, they are not informative about changes in educational or gender wage differen- tials. Thus we explore ways to tighten these bounds using restrictions motivated from economic theory. With these assumptions, we find convincing evidence of an increase in inequality within education groups, changes in educational differentials, and increases in the relative wages of women.",

    "abstract": "Rationalizability is a central solution concept of game theory. Economic models often have many rationalizable outcomes, motivating economists to use refinements of rationalizability, including equilibrium refinements. In this paper we try to achieve a general understanding of when this multiplicity occurs and how one should deal with it. Assuming that the set of possible payoff functions and belief structures is sufficiently rich, we establish a revealing structure of the correspondence of beliefs to sets of rationalizable outcomes. We show that, for any rationalizable action a of any type, we can perturb the beliefs of the type in such a way that a is uniquely rationalizable for the new type. This unique outcome will be robust to further small changes. When multiplicity occurs, then we are in a \"knife-edge\" case, where the unique rationalizable outcome changes, sandwiched between open sets of types where each of the rationalizable actions is uniquely rationalizable. As an immediate application of this result, we characterize, for any refinement of rationalizability, the predictions that are robust to small misspecifications of interim beliefs. These are only those predictions that are true for all rationalizable strategies, that is, the predictions that could have been made without the refinement.",

    "abstract": "Does individual behavior in a laboratory setting provide a reliable indicator of behavior in a naturally occurring setting? We consider this general methodological question in the context of eliciting risk attitudes. The controls that are typically employed in laboratory settings, such as the use of abstract lotteries, could lead subjects to employ behavioral rules that differ from the ones they employ in the field. Because it is field behavior that we are interested in understanding, those controls might be a confound in themselves if they result in differences in behavior. We find that the use of artificial monetary prizes provides a reliable measure of risk attitudes when the natural counterpart outcome has minimal uncertainty, but that it can provide an unreliable measure when the natural counterpart outcome has background risk. Behavior tended to be moderately risk averse when artificial monetary prizes were used or when there was minimal uncertainty in the natural nonmonetary outcome, but subjects drawn from the same population were much more risk averse when their attitudes were elicited using the natural nonmonetary outcome that had some background risk. These results are consistent with conventional expected utility theory for the effects of background risk on attitudes to risk.",

    "title": "Estimating and Testing Structural Changes in Multivariate Regressions",
    "abstract": "This paper considers issues related to estimation, inference, and computation with multiple structural changes that occur at unknown dates in a system of equations. Changes can occur in the regression coefficients and/or the covariance matrix of the errors. We also allow arbitrary restrictions on these parameters, which permits the analysis of partial structural change models, common breaks that occur in all equations, breaks that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth. The method of estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal errors. The limiting distributions are obtained under more general assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose likelihood ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of no structural change and to select the number of changes. Structural change tests with restrictions on the parameters can be constructed to achieve higher power when prior information is present. For computation, an algorithm for an efficient procedure is proposed to construct the estimates and test statistics. We also introduce a novel locally ordered breaks model, which allows the breaks in different equations to be related yet not occurring at the same dates.",

Failure to account for misclassification is shown to result in attenuation bias in the estimated treatment effect. An identifying assumption that overcomes this bias is the existence of an instrument for the binary regressor that is conditionally independent of the treatment effect. A discrete instrument suffices for nonparametric identification.",

In the presence of short range serial correlation, we propose a simple and efficient two-step test that avoids the estimation of a nonlinear regression model. In addition, the first-order asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are not affected by the preestimation of short or long memory parameters.",

This includes the homothetic case which is given special attention in Section 4. (ii) For the Slutsky equation to indicate demand behavior in the large, it is sufficient that along any given indifference curve the ratio of changes in price to changes in quantity be bounded from zero (Section 5). (iii) Even with almost everywhere differentiable demand derived from continuously differentiable utility, most change in demand does not necessarily take place where the Slutsky equation is valid (Section 5). (iv) By way of proof of Theorems 1-3, it is shown that the maximand in a Lagrange problem is differentiable under appropriate conditions on the function being maximized (Theorem 6, Section 3, and Appendix). (v) For preferences as in (ii) and for almost all wealths, equilibrium is locally unique (Section 6).",

This paper suggests that in many cases, the construction of a small-scale simulation can \"prepare\" the data for regression in a manner which takes cognizance of the theory of the process. Regression is then used to scale the output of the simulation up to observed magnitudes of the variable to be predicted. The simulation has the function of exploring for the nature of the nonlinearities and interactions and thus replaces the usual search for a form which maximizes R^2. The simulation may also be helpful where colinear data are a problem. An example is presented in which the effects of wages, unemployment rates, and labor turnover on poverty are studied through a \"prepared\" regression.",

    "title": "The Costs of Substitution",
    "abstract": "The lecture investigates some consequences of a frequently observed phenomenon: There are once and for all costs of switching from one good to one of its substitutes. The decision to substitute then is an investment decision. Such substitution costs, in conjunction with problems of oppportunism, have frequently been seen as a reason for vertical integration. Reputation for a fair treatment of customers may enable suppliers to maintain market relations for goods involving substitution costs. A model looks at \"competitive distance\" between two goods with substitution costs. If future tastes are uncertain the model shows that with low rates of discount or high rates of market growth competitive distance declines as substitution costs rise. It is also shown that competitive distance rises with a rising rate of discount. Given the effectiveness of the reputation mechanism, numerical analysis shows that competitive distance is smaller in most cases with substitution costs than without substitution costs.",

A natural method of allocating buyers among firms arises in the equilibrium of the buyers' search game. Sufficient conditions are given under which the buyers' equilibrium varies continuously with the prices charged by firms. Capacity constraints are used to guarantee that this ensures existence of (mixed strategy) equilibria for the pricing game played by sellers. We show that natural pure strategy equilibria arise when the game is made large in appropriate ways.",

The problem is formulated as a dynamic game in which utility functions are additively separable. It is shown that the game possesses perfect Nash equilibria whose outcomes are Pareto optima. Moreover, any individually rational Pareto optimum can be attained through one of these Nash equilibria. Strategies in these equilibria involve a rate of revision in the quantity of the public good that is equal to the threshold level and insures montonic convergence of the procedure in finite time.",

The findings suggest selectivity is of considerable importance and support the comparative advantage hypothesis of Willis and Rosen [18].",

    "title": "Specification Tests for the Multinomial Logit Model",
    "abstract": "Discrete choice models are now used in a variety of situations in applied econometrics. By far the model specification which is used most often is the multinomial logit model. Yet it is widely known that a potentially important drawback of the multinomial logit model is the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. While most analysts recognize the implications of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property, it has remained basically a maintained assumption in applications. In the paper we provide two sets of computationally convenient specification tests for the multinomial logit model. The first test is an application of the Hausman [10] specification test procedure. The basic idea for the test here is to test the reverse implication of the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. The test statistic is easy to compute since it only requires computation of a quadratic form which involves the difference of the parameter estimates and the differences of the estimated covariance matrices. The second set of specification tests that we propose is based on more classical test procedures. We consider a generalization of the multinomial logit model which is called the nested logit model. Since the multinomial logit model is a special case of the more general model when a given parameter equals one, classical test procedures such as the Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests can be used. The two sets of specification test procedures care then compared for an example where exact and approximate comparisons are possible.",

In particular, we will derive an expression for posterior odds to compare models for the minimal prior information case. In this framework, models are compared according to their relative posterior probabilities, termed the posterior odds (conditioned on prior and data-sample information). We will show that the criterion obtained here reflects a tradeoff between parsimony (i.e. parameter space dimensionality) and data fit, has desirable invariance properties, and applies to nested and nonnested model comparisons. Furthermore, in nested model comparisons, this criterion can be interpreted in terms of an adjusted likelihood ratio test in which for large data samples the significance level is a declining function of the sample size. Finally, as a practical matter the criterion obtained here is computationally no more difficult to compute than the classical F ratio, and can be calculated easily from the output of standard regression computer programs.",

While several analyses of the Klein-Goldberger and the Suits models have been completed, the forecasting performance of other models has not been analyzed. Since the Klein-Goldberger and Suits models have already been discussed, our attention will be focused on six quarterly models whose predictive performance has not been previously evaluated. Prior to performing each evaluation, the main characteristics of the particular model will be reviewed, but the equation system itself will not be presented. This procedure will provide perspectives about the scope of the model, the period to which it was fit, and the type of predictions that it generated. Before presenting this analysis, it is, however, necessary to discuss the variety of methods that may be utilized to evaluate these models, for there is no consensus on the one best procedure to be used, and to provide caveats that should be considered in interpreting the results.",

We then establish theorems on \"substitutable\" and \"complementary\" commodities which are not, in general, valid for the traditional theory. Finally, a set of qualitative restrictions on demand functions is deduced, of which a subset is identical to the traditional restrictions.",

Both are used to explain occupational (skill) differences in short-run employment experience among railroad workers. Implications of these investments for the demand, variability, and timing of hours of work per man are developed and tested, and substitution parameters are estimated from cross-section data.",

Quadratic teams concern team decision problems where the organizational objective criterion is represented by a quadratic function of the action and state variables. The purpose of this paper is to explicitly relate the analysis of quadratic team decision problems to recent research on optimal decision rules for aggregate planning--for example, as reported by Holt et al [5], Theil [9], van de Panne [10], and others. A numerical example is presented based on the well known microeconomic model of production and employment scheduling in a paint factory.",

    "abstract": "Lévy-Lambert shows in [3], for a specific example, how the marginal cost pricing principle must be modified to take into account an imperfect environment. The author studies the case of two existing, perfectly substitutable facilities, namely a turnpike and a highway, connecting two given locations. It is well known that an optimal resource allocation can be attained only by levying a toll on users during congested hours. These tolls must be such that the private cost of the trip on each facility is equal to its marginal social cost. In practice, however, there are often constraints that prevent reaching this goal. Thus, what is the optimal toll to be charged on the turnpike, when it is impossible to levy a toll on the high way? We owe the answer to this question to Lévy-Lambert. The purposes of the present note are: (i) to derive explicitly Lévy-Lambert's result from a general equilibrium model and in the process to exhibit a minor qualification; (ii) to derive a few additional results, especially about the optimal redistribution of incomes; and (iii) to illustrate by a simple example a general methodology for analyzing ``second best'' models, already used with success in other fields.",

    "title": "Bayesian Analysis of Haavelmo's Models",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the exact posterior distributions of the parameters of Haavelmo's model I is derived for locally uniform prior distributions. Marginal distributions of the parameters have been obtained for Haavelmo's data. Then the predictive probability density of the model is derived for given values of the exogenous variable, investment. In order to check some of the specifying assumptions, the model is expanded and analyzed under the assumption that the error terms are generated by a first order autoregressive scheme. Exact finite sample results are obtained and the posterior distributions are computed for Haavelmo's data. Conditional distributions of the parameters of the model are computed for given values of the autocorrelation parameter, ρ, in order to assess the effects of departures from our specifying assumptions. Another specifying assumption that is examined concerns the exogenous nature of investment. For this, Haavelmo's model II, in which investment is assumed to be endogenous, is used. Posterior distributions of the parameters of the model are computed for this model. The sensitiveness of the inference about the parameters of the model to the assumption that investment is exogeneous is studied by computing various conditional distributions for model II. It is seen that this assumption is very crucial for Haavelmo's data. Finally, two different prior distributions reflecting two different views about investment are introduced. The posterior distributions of the same parameter are then used to determine how one's prior belief is modified by the sample information.",

The first puzzle concerns wage inequality between educational groups, which has substantially risen in the US and the UK during the past two decades following a sharp increase in the supply of educated labor. The second puzzle concerns wage inequality within educational groups, which accounts for a large fraction of the observed increase in wage inequality, although in contrast to between-group wage inequality it has mainly affected the temporary component of income.",

Moreover, the answer is in the affirmative, both in theory and in practice. In particular, recent theoretical work predicts systematic effects of electoral rules and political regimes on the size and composition of government spending. Results from ongoing empirical work indicate that such effects are indeed present in the data. Some empirical results are consistent with theoretical predictions: presidential regimes have smaller governments and countries with majoritarian elections have smaller welfare-state programs and less corruption. Other results present puzzles for future research: the adjustment to economic events appears highly institution-dependent, as does the timing and nature of the electoral cycle.",

    "abstract": "Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), Baxter and Crucini (1995), and Stockman and Tesar (1995) find two major discrepancies between standard international business cycle models with complete markets and the data: In the models, cross-country correlations are much higher for consumption than for output, while in the data the opposite is true; and cross-country correlations of employment and investment are negative, while in the data they are positive. This paper introduces a friction into a standard model that helps resolve these anomalies. The friction is that international loans are imperfectly enforceable; any country can renege on its debts and suffer the consequences for future borrowing. To solve for equilibrium in this economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of Marcet and Marimon (1999) are extended. Incorporating the friction helps resolve the anomalies more than does exogenously restricting the assets that can be traded.",

    "title": "Nash Implementation: A Full Characterization",
    "abstract": "We extend Maskin's results on Nash implementation. First, we establish a condition which is both necessary and sufficient for Nash implementability if there are three or more agents (this was the case covered by Maskin's sufficiency result). Second--and more important--we examine the two-agent case (for which there existed no general sufficiency results). The two-agent model is of course the leading case for applications to contracting and bargaining. For this case, too, we establish a condition which is both necessary and sufficient for Nash implementability. We use our theorems to derive simpler sufficiency conditions that are applicable in a wide variety of economic environments.",

    "title": "Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation",
    "abstract": "When drawing up a contract, it is often impracticable for the parties to specify all the relevant contingencies. In particular, they may be unable to describe the states of the world in enough detail that an outsider (the courts) could later verify which state had occurred, and so the contract will be incomplete. The parties can make up for this incompleteness to some extent bybuilding into the contract a mechanism for revising the terms of trade as they each receive information about benefits and costs. One striking conclusion of our analysis is that because the parties can rescind the original contract and write a new one, severe limitations are placed on the form the revisions can take. Moreover, these limitations depend crucially on what means of communication the parties have at their disposal during the revision process. We characterize an optimal contract in two cases. First, when a contract is being used to facilitate trade between two agents who must undertake relationship-specific investments, it is generally not possible to implement the first-best. Fora a particular example, we are able to confirm the idea that the second-best outcome will involve under-investment. Second, when a contract is being used to share risk, and there are no specific investments, we find that it is possible to implement the first-best provided messages sent between the agents can be publicly verified.",

    "abstract": "Competition is not a natural state. Under it, firms become dissatisfied with performance and work to change the structure. What they seek is a structure that supports sufficient discipline to assure individual actions consistent with common interests. Often, the changes have been effected before the industry is prominent enough to command public attention. This is not so in computer services. The industry, already prominent, is still competitive. In this paper, the author describes the industry and suggests why and how changes in its structure may occur.",

    "title": "Effects of Restrictive Harvest Criteria on Antler Size of Hunter-harvested Male White-tailed Deer and Hunter Opportunity",
    "abstract": "Antler-based selective harvest criteria (SHC; e.g., number of points) are a commonly used and effective method of limiting harvest of 1.5-year-old male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, previous research has shown SHC that allow disproportionate harvest of young males with large antlers may reduce average antler size within older (≥2.5-yr) age classes. We used hunter-harvest data collected from 10 wildlife management areas in Georgia, USA, during 2003–2013 to compare cohort antler size and other factors among areas with varying or no SHC. Three of the areas restricted harvest to males with one antler beam ≥41 cm long or an antler spread ≥38 cm (BS), and another 3 restricted harvest to males with ≥4 antler points on one side (4OS). Any male with visible antlers was eligible for harvest on the remaining areas. There was no evidence that either BS or 4OS criteria led to a decrease in antler size of harvested males ≥2.5 years old. Both SHC protected ≥96% of 1.5-year males from harvest. There was also evidence to suggest the BS criteria increased mean antler size of harvested males and annual harvest rates of 3.5-year males. However, the 4OS criteria protected 49%, 16%, and 9% of 2.5, 3.5, and ≥4.5-year males, respectively. The BS criteria protected 77%, 33%, and 10% of the same age classes. These findings suggest restrictive SHC can prevent decline in antler size of harvested males and increase opportunity for hunters to harvest older males with larger antlers, with the added biological benefit of increasing the population age structure. However, restrictive SHC may unintentionally protect a significant proportion of ≥2.5-year males from harvest. As previously suggested, managers interested in SHC should carefully research site- and age-specific antler size to avoid implementation of criteria that are either too restrictive or permissive.",
